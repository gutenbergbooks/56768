THE LION AND THE UNICORN
<br />

</h2>

<p>
Prentiss had a long lease on the
house, and because it stood in Jermyn
Street the upper floors were, as a
matter of course, turned into lodgings for
single gentlemen; and because Prentiss
was a Florist to the Queen, he placed a
lion and unicorn over his flower-shop, just
in front of the middle window on the first
floor. By stretching a little, each of them
could see into the window just beyond
him, and could hear all that was said inside;
and such things as they saw and
heard during the reign of Captain Carrington,
who moved in at the same time they
did! By day the table in the centre of
the room was covered with maps, and the
Captain sat with a box of pins, with different-colored
flags wrapped around them,
and amused himself by sticking them in the
maps and measuring the spaces in between,
swearing meanwhile to himself. It was a
selfish amusement, but it appeared to be
the Captain's only intellectual pursuit, for
at night, the maps were rolled up, and a
green cloth was spread across the table,
and there was much company and popping
of soda-bottles, and little heaps of
gold and silver were moved this way and
that across the cloth. The smoke drifted
out of the open windows, and the laughter
of the Captain's guests rang out loudly in
the empty street, so that the policeman
halted and raised his eyes reprovingly to
the lighted windows, and cabmen drew up
beneath them and lay in wait, dozing on
their folded arms, for the Captain's guests
to depart. The Lion and the Unicorn
were rather ashamed of the scandal of it,
and they were glad when, one day, the
Captain went away with his tin boxes and
gun-cases piled high on a four-wheeler.
</p>

<p>
Prentiss stood on the sidewalk and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
said: "I wish you good luck, sir." And
the Captain said: "I'm coming back a
Major, Prentiss." But he never came
back. And one day&mdash;the Lion remembered
the day very well, for on that same
day the newsboys ran up and down
Jermyn Street shouting out the news of
"a 'orrible disaster" to the British arms.
It was then that a young lady came to
the door in a hansom, and Prentiss went
out to meet her and led her up-stairs.
They heard him unlock the Captain's
door and say, "This is his room, miss,"
and after he had gone they watched her
standing quite still by the centre-table.
She stood there for a very long time looking
slowly about her, and then she took a
photograph of the Captain from the frame
on the mantel and slipped it into her pocket,
and when she went out again her veil
was down, and she was crying. She must
have given Prentiss as much as a sovereign,
for he called her "Your ladyship,"
which he never did under a sovereign.
</p>

<p>
And she drove off, and they never saw
her again either, nor could they hear the
address she gave the cabman. But it was
somewhere up St. John's Wood way.
</p>

<p>
After that the rooms were empty for
some months, and the Lion and the Unicorn
were forced to amuse themselves
with the beautiful ladies and smart looking
men who came to Prentiss to buy
flowers and "buttonholes," and the little
round baskets of strawberries, and even
the peaches at three shillings each, which
looked so tempting as they lay in the
window, wrapped up in cotton-wool, like
jewels of great price.
</p>

<p>
Then Philip Carroll, the American gentleman,
came, and they heard Prentiss telling
him that those rooms had always let
for five guineas a week, which they knew
was not true; but they also knew that in
the economy of nations there must always
be a higher price for the rich American,
or else why was he given that strange accent,
except to betray him into the hands
of the London shopkeeper, and the London
cabby?
</p>

<p>
The American walked to the window
toward the west, which was the window
nearest the Lion, and looked out into the
graveyard of St. James's Church, that
stretched between their street and Piccadilly.
</p>

<p>
"You're lucky in having a bit of green
to look out on," he said to Prentiss. "I'll
take these rooms&mdash;at five guineas. That's
more than they're worth, you know, but as
I know it, too, your conscience needn't
trouble you."
</p>

<p>
Then his eyes fell on the Lion, and he
nodded to him gravely. "How do you
do?" he said. "I'm coming to live with
you for a little time. I have read about
you and your friends over there. It is a
hazard of new fortunes with me, your Majesty,
so be kind to me, and if I win, I
will put a new coat of paint on your shield
and gild you all over again."
</p>

<p>
Prentiss smiled obsequiously at the
American's pleasantry, but the new lodger
only stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"He seemed a social gentleman," said
the Unicorn, that night, when the Lion
and he were talking it over. "Now the
Captain, the whole time he was here, never
gave us so much as a look. This one says
he has read of us."
</p>

<p>
"And why not?" growled the Lion. "I
hope Prentiss heard what he said of our
needing a new layer of gilt. It's disgraceful.
You can see that Lion over Scarlett's,
the butcher, as far as Regent Street,
and Scarlett is only one of Salisbury's
creations. He received his Letters-Patent
only two years back. We date from
Palmerston."
</p>

<p>
The lodger came up the street just at
that moment, and stopped and looked up
at the Lion and the Unicorn from the sidewalk,
before he opened the door with his
night-key. They heard him enter the room
and feel on the mantel for his pipe, and a
moment later he appeared at the Lion's
window and leaned on the sill, looking
down into the street below and blowing
whiffs of smoke up into the warm night-air.

<p>
It was a night in June, and the pavements
were dry under foot and the streets
were filled with well-dressed people, going
home from the play, and with groups of
men in black and white, making their
way to supper at the clubs. Hansoms of
inky-black, with shining lamps inside and
out, dashed noiselessly past on mysterious
errands, chasing close on each other's heels
on a mad race, each to its separate goal.
From the cross streets rose the noises of
early night, the rumble of the 'buses, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
creaking of their brakes, as they unlocked,
the cries of the "extras," and the merging
of thousands of human voices in a dull murmur.
The great world of London was closing
its shutters for the night, and putting
out the lights; and the new lodger from
across the sea listened to it with his heart
beating quickly, and laughed to stifle the
touch of fear and homesickness that rose
in him.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen a great play to-night,"
he said to the Lion; "nobly played by
great players. What will they care for my
poor wares? I see that I have been over-bold.
But we cannot go back now&mdash;not
yet."
</p>

<p>
He knocked the ashes out of his pipe,
and nodded "good-night" to the great
world beyond his window. "What fortunes
lie with ye, ye lights of London
town?" he quoted, smiling. And they
heard him close the door of his bedroom,
and lock it for the night.
</p>

<p>
The next morning he bought many geraniums
from Prentiss and placed them
along the broad cornice that stretched
across the front of the house over the shop-window.
The flowers made a band of
scarlet on either side of the Lion as brilliant
as a Tommy's jacket.
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to propitiate the British
Lion by placing flowers before his altar,"
the American said that morning to a visitor.
</p>

<p>
"The British public, you mean," said
the visitor; "they are each likely to tear
you to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have heard that the pit on the
first night of a bad play is something awful,"
hazarded the American.
</p>

<p>
"Wait and see," said the visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said the American,
meekly.
</p>

<p>
Everyone who came to the first floor
front talked about a play. It seemed to
be something of great moment to the
American. It was only a bundle of leaves
printed in red and black inks and bound
in brown paper covers. There were two
of them, and the American called them by
different names: one was his comedy and
one was his tragedy.
</p>

<p>
"They are both likely to be tragedies,"
the Lion heard one of the visitors say to
another, as they drove away together.
"Our young friend takes it too seriously."
</p>

<p>
The American spent most of his time
by his desk at the window writing on little
blue pads and tearing up what he wrote,
or in reading over one of the plays to himself
in a loud voice. In time the number
of his visitors increased, and to some of
these he would read his play; and after they
had left him he was either depressed and
silent or excited and jubilant. The Lion
could always tell when he was happy because
then he would go to the side table
and pour himself out a drink and say,
"Here's to me," but when he was depressed
he would stand holding the glass
in his hand, and finally pour the liquor back
into the bottle again and say, "What's the
use of that?"
</p>

<p>
After he had been in London a month
he wrote less and was more frequently
abroad, sallying forth in beautiful raiment,
and coming home by daylight.
</p>

<p>
And he gave suppers too, but they were
less noisy than the Captain's had been, and
the women who came to them were much
more beautiful, and their voices when they
spoke were sweet and low. Sometimes
one of the women sang, and the men sat
in silence while the people in the street
below stopped to listen, and would say,
"Why, that is So-and-So singing," and
the Lion and the Unicorn wondered how
they could know who it was when they
could not see her.
</p>

<p>
The lodger's visitors came to see him
at all hours. They seemed to regard his
rooms as a club, where they could always
come for a bite to eat or to write notes;
and others treated it like a lawyer's office
and asked advice on all manner of strange
subjects. Sometimes the visitor wanted
to know whether the American thought
she ought to take £10 a week and go on
tour, or stay in town and try to live on £8;
or whether she should paint landscapes
that would not sell, or race-horses that
would; or whether Reggie really loved her
and whether she really loved Reggie; or
whether the new part in the piece at the
Court was better than the old part at
Terry's, and wasn't she getting too old to
play "ingénues" anyway.
</p>

<p>
The lodger seemed to be a general adviser,
and smoked and listened with grave
consideration, and the Unicorn thought
his judgment was most sympathetic and
sensible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Of all the beautiful ladies who came to
call on the lodger the one the Unicorn
liked the best was the one who wanted to
know whether she loved Reggie and
whether Reggie loved her. She discussed
this so interestingly while she consumed
tea and thin slices of bread that the Unicorn
almost lost his balance in leaning forward
to listen. Her name was Marion
Cavendish, and it was written over many
photographs which stood in silver frames
in the lodger's rooms. She used to make
the tea herself, while the lodger sat and
smoked; and she had a fascinating way of
doubling the thin slices of bread into long
strips and nibbling at them like a mouse
at a piece of cheese. She had wonderful
little teeth and Cupid's-bow lips, and she
had a fashion of lifting her veil only high
enough for one to see the two Cupid-bow
lips. When she did that the American
used to laugh, at nothing apparently, and
say, "Oh, I guess Reggie loves you well
enough."
</p>

<p>
"But do I love Reggie?" she would ask
sadly, with her tea-cup held poised in air.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I hope not," the lodger
would reply, and she would put down the
veil quickly, as one would drop a curtain
over a beautiful picture, and rise with great
dignity and say, "If you talk like that I
shall not come again."
</p>

<p>
She was sure that if she could only get
some work to do her head would be filled
with more important matters than whether
Reggie loved her or not.
</p>

<p>
"But the managers seem inclined to
cut their cavendish very fine just at present,"
she said. "If I don't get a part
soon," she announced, "I shall ask Mitchell
to put me down on the list for recitations
at evening-parties."
</p>

<p>
"That seems a desperate revenge," said
the American; "and besides, I don't want
you to get a part, because someone might
be idiotic enough to take my comedy, and
if he should, you must play <i>Nancy</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I would not ask for any salary if I
could play <i>Nancy</i>," Miss Cavendish answered.
</p>

<p>
They spoke of a great many things, but
their talk always ended by her saying that
there must be someone with sufficient
sense to see that his play was a great play,
and by his saying that none but she must
play <i>Nancy</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Lion preferred the tall girl with
masses and folds of brown hair, who came
from America to paint miniatures of the
British aristocracy. Her name was Helen
Cabot, and he liked her because she was
so brave and fearless, and so determined
to be independent of everyone, even of
the lodger&mdash;especially of the lodger,
who it appeared had known her very well
at home. The lodger, they gathered,
did not wish her to be independent of
him, and the two Americans had many
arguments and disputes about it, but she
always said, "It does no good, Philip; it
only hurts us both when you talk so. I
care for nothing and for no one but my
art, and, poor as it is, it means everything
to me, and you do not, and, of course, the
man I am to marry, must." Then Carroll
would talk, walking up and down, and
looking very fierce and determined, and
telling her how he loved her in such a way
that it made her look even more proud
and beautiful. And she would say more
gently, "It is very fine to think that anyone
can care for one like that, and very
helpful. But unless I cared in the same
way it would be wicked of me to marry
you, and besides&mdash;&mdash;" She would add
very quickly to prevent his speaking
again&mdash;"I don't want to marry you or
anybody, and I never shall. I want to be
free and to succeed in my work, just as
you want to succeed in your work. So
please never speak of this again." When
she went away the lodger used to sit smoking
in the big arm-chair and beat the arms
with his hands, and he would pace up and
down the room while his work would lie
untouched and his engagements pass forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Summer came and London was deserted,
dull and dusty, but the lodger
stayed on in Jermyn Street. Helen Cabot
had departed on a round of visits to
country houses in Scotland, where, as she
wrote him, she was painting miniatures of
her hosts and studying the game of golf.
Miss Cavendish divided her days between
the river and one of the West End theatres.
She was playing a small part in a farce-comedy.
</p>

<p>
One day she came up from Cookham
earlier than usual, looking very beautiful
in a white boating frock and a straw hat
with a Leander ribbon. Her hands and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
arms were hard with dragging a punting
pole, and she was sun-burnt and happy,
and hungry for tea.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you come down to Cookham
and get out of this heat?" Miss Cavendish
asked. "You need it; you look
ill."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to, but I can't," said Carroll.
"The fact is, I paid in advance for these
rooms, and if I lived anywhere else I'd be
losing five guineas a week on them."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish regarded him severely.
She had never quite mastered his American
humor.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;five guineas&mdash;why that's nothing
to you," she said. Something in the
lodger's face made her pause. "You
don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," said the lodger, smiling.
"You see, I started in to lay siege to London
without sufficient ammunition. London
is a large town, and it didn't fall
as quickly as I thought it would. So I
am economizing. Mr. Lockhart's Coffee
Rooms and I are no longer strangers."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish put down her cup of
tea untasted and leaned toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Are you in earnest?" she asked. "For
how long?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for the last month," replied the
lodger; "they are not at all bad&mdash;clean
and wholesome and all that."
</p>

<p>
"But the suppers you gave us, and
this," she cried, suddenly, waving her
hands over the pretty tea-things, "and
the cake and muffins?"
</p>

<p>
"My friends, at least," said Carroll,
"need not go to Lockhart's."
</p>

<p>
"And the Savoy?" asked Miss Cavendish,
mournfully shaking her head.
</p>

<p>
"A dream of the past," said Carroll,
waving his pipe through the smoke.
"Gatti's? Yes, on special occasions; but
for necessity, the Chancellor's, where one
gets a piece of the prime roast beef of
Old England, from Chicago, and potatoes
for ninepence&mdash;a pot of bitter two-pence
half-penny, and a penny for the waiter.
It's most amusing on the whole. I am
learning a little about London, and some
things about myself. They are both most
interesting subjects."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't like it," Miss Cavendish
declared, helplessly. "When I think of
those suppers and the flowers, I feel&mdash;I
feel like a robber."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," begged Carroll. "I am really
the most happy of men&mdash;that is, as the
chap says in the play, I would be if I
wasn't so damned miserable. But I owe
no man a penny and I have assets&mdash;I
have £80 to last me through the winter
and two marvellous plays; and I
love, next to yourself, the most wonderful
woman God ever made. That's
enough."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you made such a lot
of money by writing?" asked Miss Cavendish.
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;that is, I could," answered
Carroll, "if I wrote the things that sell;
but I keep on writing plays that won't."
</p>

<p>
"And such plays!" exclaimed Marion,
warmly; "and to think that they are going
begging." She continued indignantly,
"I can't imagine what the managers do
want."
</p>

<p>
"I know what they don't want," said
the American. Miss Cavendish drummed
impatiently on the tea-tray.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't be so abject
about it," she said. "If I were a man I'd
make them take those plays."
</p>

<p>
"How," asked the American, "with a
gun?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'd keep at it until they read
them," declared Marion. "I'd sit on
their front steps all night and I'd follow
them in cabs, and I'd lay in wait for
them at the stage-door. I'd just make
them take them."
</p>

<p>
Carroll sighed and stared at the ceiling.
"I guess I'll give up and go home," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, do, run away before you are
beaten," said Miss Cavendish, scornfully.
"Why, you can't go now. Everybody
will be back in town soon, and there
are a lot of new plays coming on, and
some of them are sure to be failures, and
that's our chance. You rush in with
your piece and somebody may take it
sooner than close the theatre."
</p>

<p>
"I'm thinking of closing the theatre
myself," said Carroll. "What's the use
of my hanging on here?" he exclaimed.
"It distresses Helen to know I am in
London, feeling about her as I do&mdash;and
the Lord only knows how it distresses me.
And, maybe if I went away," he said, consciously,
"she might miss me. She
might see the difference."

<p class="caption">He was evidently amused.
</p></div>

<p>
Miss Cavendish held herself erect and
pressed her lips together with a severe
smile. "If Helen Cabot doesn't see the
difference between you and the other men
she knows now," she said, "I doubt if
she ever will. Besides," she continued,
and then hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on," urged Carroll.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was only going to say," she
explained, "that leaving the girl alone
never did the man any good unless he
left her alone willingly. If she's sure he
still cares, it's just the same to her where
he is. He might as well stay on in London
as to go to South Africa. It won't
help him any. The difference comes
when she finds he has stopped caring.
Why, look at Reggie. He tried that.
He went away for ever so long, but he
kept writing me from wherever he went,
so that he was perfectly miserable&mdash;and I
went on enjoying myself. Then when he
came back, he tried going about with his
old friends again. He used to come to
the theatre with them&mdash;oh, with such
nice girls&mdash;but he always stood in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
back of the box and yawned and scowled&mdash;so
I knew. And, anyway, he'd always
spoil it all by leaving them and waiting
at the stage entrance for me. But one
day he got tired of the way I treated
him and went off on a bicycle tour with
Lady Hacksher's girls, and some men
from his regiment, and he was gone three
weeks and never sent me even a line; and
I got so scared; I couldn't sleep, and I
stood it for three days more, and then I
wired him to come back or I'd jump
off London Bridge; and he came back
that very night from Edinburgh on the
express, and I was so glad to see him
that I got confused, and in the general
excitement I promised to marry him, so
that's how it was with us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the American, without enthusiasm;
"but then I still care, and Helen
knows I care."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't she ever fancy that you might
care for someone else? You have a lot
of friends, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but she knows they are just that&mdash;friends,"
said the American.
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish stood up to go, and
arranged her veil before the mirror above
the fire-place.
</p>

<p>
"I come here very often to tea," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"It's very kind of you," said Carroll.
He was at the open window, looking
down into the street for a cab.
</p>

<p>
"Well, no one knows I am engaged to
Reggie," continued Miss Cavendish, "except
you and Reggie, and he isn't so sure.
<i>She</i> doesn't know it."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Carroll.
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish smiled a mischievous,
kindly smile at him from the mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she repeated, mockingly.
Carroll stared at her and laughed. After
a pause he said: "It's like a plot in a
comedy. But I'm afraid I'm too serious
for play-acting."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is serious," said Miss Cavendish.
She seated herself again and regarded
the American thoughtfully. "You
are too good a man to be treated the
way that girl is treating you, and no one
knows it better than she does. She'll
change in time, but just now she thinks
she wants to be independent. She's in
love with this picture-painting idea, and
with the people she meets. It's all new
to her&mdash;the fuss they make over her and
the titles, and the way she is asked about.
We know she can't paint. We know
they only give her commissions because
she's so young and pretty, and American.
She amuses them, that's all. Well,
that cannot last; she'll find it out. She's
too clever a girl, and she is too fine a
girl to be content with that long. Then&mdash;then
she'll come back to you. She
feels now that she has both you and the
others, and she's making you wait: so
wait, and be cheerful. She's worth waiting
for; she's young, that's all. She'll see
the difference in time. But, in the meanwhile,
it would hurry matters a bit if she
thought she had to choose between the
new friends and you."
</p>

<p>
"She could still keep her friends, and
marry me," said Carroll; "I have told
her that a hundred times. She could still
paint miniatures and marry me. But she
won't marry me."
</p>

<p>
"She won't marry you because she
knows she can whenever she wants to,"
cried Marion. "Can't you see that? But
if she thought you were going to marry
someone else now?"
</p>

<p>
"She would be the first to congratulate
me," said Carroll. He rose and walked to
the fire-place, where he leaned with his
arm on the mantel. There was a photograph
of Helen Cabot near his hand,
and he turned this toward him and stood
for some time staring at it. "My dear
Marion," he said at last, "I've known
Helen ever since she was as young as
that. Every year I've loved her more,
and found new things in her to care for;
now I love her more than any other man
ever loved any other woman."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish shook her head sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," she said; "that's the
way Reggie loves me, too."
</p>

<p>
Carroll went on as though he had not
heard her.
</p>

<p>
"There's a bench in St. James's Park,"
he said, "where we used to sit when she
first came here, when she didn't know so
many people. We used to go there in
the morning and throw penny buns to the
ducks. That's been my amusement this
summer since you've all been away&mdash;sitting
on that bench, feeding penny buns to
the silly ducks&mdash;especially the black one,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
the one she used to like best. And I
make pilgrimages to all the other places
we ever visited together, and try to pretend
she is with me. And I support the
crossing-sweeper at Lansdowne Passage
because she once said she felt sorry for
him. I do all the other absurd things
that a man in love tortures himself by doing.
But to what end? She knows how I
care, and yet she won't see why we can't
go on being friends as we once were.
What's the use of it all?"
</p>

<p>
"She is young, I tell you," repeated
Miss Cavendish, "and she's too sure of
you. You've told her you care, now try
making her think you don't care."
</p>

<p>
Carroll shook his head impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I will not stoop to such tricks and
pretence, Marion," he cried, impatiently.
"All I have is my love for her; if I have
to cheat and to trap her into caring, the
whole thing would be degraded."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cavendish shrugged her shoulders
and walked to the door. "Such amateurs!"
she exclaimed, and banged the
door after her.
</p>

<p>
Carroll never quite knew how he had
come to make a confidante of Miss Cavendish.
Helen and he had met her when
they first arrived in London, and as she
had acted for a season in the United
States, she adopted the two Americans&mdash;and
told Helen where to go for boots and
hats, and advised Carroll about placing
his plays. Helen soon made other friends,
and deserted the artists, with whom her
work had first thrown her. She seemed
to prefer the society of the people who
bought her paintings, and who admired
and made much of the painter. As she
was very beautiful and at an age when
she enjoyed everything in life keenly and
eagerly, to give her pleasure was in itself
a distinct pleasure; and the worldly tired
people she met were considering their own
entertainment quite as much as hers when
they asked her to their dinners and dances,
or to spend a week with them in the country.
In her way, she was as independent
as was Carroll in his, and as she was not
in love, as he was, her life was not narrowed
down to but one ideal. But she
was not so young as to consider herself
infallible, and she had one excellent friend
on whom she was dependent for advice
and to whose directions she submitted implicitly.
This was Lady Gower, the only
person to whom Helen had spoken of
Carroll and of his great feeling for her.
Lady Gower, immediately after her marriage,
had been a conspicuous and brilliant
figure in that set in London which works
eighteen hours a day to keep itself amused,
but after the death of her husband she
had disappeared into the country as completely
as though she had entered a convent,
and after several years had then
re-entered the world as a professional philanthropist.
Her name was now associated
entirely with Women's Leagues, with committees
that presented petitions to Parliament,
and with public meetings, at which
she spoke with marvellous ease and effect.
Her old friends said she had taken up
this new pose as an outlet for her nervous
energies, and as an effort to forget the
man who alone had made life serious to
her. Others knew her as an earnest woman,
acting honestly for what she thought
was right. Her success, all admitted, was
due to her knowledge of the world and to
her sense of humor, which taught her with
whom to use her wealth and position, and
when to demand what she wanted solely
on the ground that the cause was just.
</p>

<p>
She had taken more than a fancy to
Helen, and the position of the beautiful,
motherless girl had appealed to her as
one filled with dangers. When she grew to
know Helen better, she recognized that
these fears were quite unnecessary, and as
she saw more of her she learned to care
for her deeply. Helen had told her much
of Carroll and of his double purpose in
coming to London; of his brilliant work
and his lack of success in having it recognized;
and of his great and loyal devotion
to her, and of his lack of success, not in
having that recognized, but in her own inability
to return it. Helen was proud that
she had been able to make Carroll care
for her as he did, and that there was anything
about her which could inspire a man
whom she admired so much, to believe in
her so absolutely and for so long a time.
But what convinced her that the outcome
for which he hoped was impossible, was
the very fact that she could admire him,
and see how fine and unselfish his love for
her was, and yet remain untouched by it.
</p>

<p>
She had been telling Lady Gower one
day of the care he had taken of her ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
since she was fourteen years of age, and
had quoted some of the friendly and loverlike
acts he had performed in her service,
until one day they had both found
out that his attitude of the elder brother
was no longer possible, and that he loved
her in the old and only way. Lady Gower
looked at her rather doubtfully and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would bring him to see
me, Helen," she said; "I think I should
like your friend very much. From what
you tell me of him I doubt if you will find
many such men waiting for you in this
country. Our men marry for reasons of
property, or they love blindly, and are exacting
and selfish before and after they
are married. I know, because so many
women came to me when my husband
was alive to ask how it was that I continued
so happy in my married life."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to marry anyone,"
Helen remonstrated, gently. "American
girls are not always thinking only of getting
married."
</p>

<p>
"What I meant was this," said Lady
Gower, "that, in my experience, I have
heard of but few men who care in the way
this young man seems to care for you.
You say you do not love him, but if he
had wanted to gain my interest, he could
not have pleaded his case better than you
have done. He seems to see your faults
and yet love you still, in spite of them&mdash;or
on account of them. And I like the
things he does for you. I like, for instance,
his sending you the book of the
moment every week for two years. That
shows a most unswerving spirit of devotion.
And the story of the broken bridge
in the woods is a wonderful story. If I
were a young girl, I could love a man for
that alone. It was a beautiful thing to
do."
</p>

<p>
Helen sat with her chin on her hands,
deeply considering this new point of view.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it very foolish of him," she
confessed, questioningly, "to take such a
risk for such a little thing."
</p>

<p>
Lady Gower smiled down at her from
the height of her many years.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she said, dryly; "you are very
young now&mdash;and very rich; everyone is
crowding to give you pleasure, to show his
admiration. You are a very fortunate
girl. But later, these things which some
man has done because he loved you, and
which you call foolish, will grow large in
your life, and shine out strongly, and
when you are discouraged and alone, you
will take them out, and the memory of
them will make you proud and happy.
They are the honors which women wear
in secret."
</p>

<p>
Helen came back to town in September,
and for the first few days was so occupied
in refurnishing her studio and in
visiting the shops that she neglected to
send Carroll word of her return. When
she found that a whole week had passed
without her having made any effort to see
him, and appreciated how the fact would
hurt her friend, she was filled with remorse,
and drove at once in great haste to
Jermyn Street, to announce her return in
person. On the way she decided that she
would soften the blow of her week of neglect
by asking him to take her out to
luncheon. This privilege she had once
or twice accorded him, and she felt that
the pleasure these excursions gave Carroll
were worth the consternation they caused
to Lady Gower.
</p>

<p>
The servant was uncertain whether Mr.
Carroll was at home or not, but Helen was
too intent upon making restitution to wait
for the fact to be determined, and, running
up the stairs, knocked sharply at the door
of his study.
</p>

<p>
A voice bade her come in, and she entered
radiant and smiling her welcome.
But Carroll was not there to receive it,
and instead, Marion Cavendish looked up
at her from his desk where she was busily
writing. Helen paused with a surprised
laugh, but Marion sprang up and hailed
her gladly. They met half way across the
room and kissed each other with the most
friendly feeling.
</p>

<p>
Philip was out, Marion said, and she
had just stepped in for a moment to write
him a note. If Helen would excuse her,
she would finish it, as she was late for rehearsal.
</p>

<p>
But she asked over her shoulder, with
great interest, if Helen had passed a
pleasant summer. She thought she had
never seen her looking so well. Helen
thought Miss Cavendish herself was looking
very well also, but Marion said no;
that she was too sunburnt, she would not
be able to wear a dinner-dress for a month.
There was a pause while Marion's quill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
scratched violently across Carroll's note-paper.
Helen felt that in some way she
was being treated as an intruder; or worse,
as a guest. She did not sit down, it
seemed impossible to do so, but she moved
uncertainly about the room. She noted
that there were many changes, it seemed
more bare and empty; her picture was still
on the writing-desk, but there were at least
six new photographs of Marion. Marion
herself had brought them to the room that
morning, and had carefully arranged them
in conspicuous places. But Helen could
not know that. She thought there was an
unnecessary amount of writing scribbled
over the face of each.
</p>

<p>
Marion addressed her letter and wrote
"Immediate" across the envelope, and
placed it before the clock on the mantel-shelf.
"You will find Philip looking
very badly," she said, as she pulled on her
gloves. "He has been in town all summer,
working very hard&mdash;he has had no
holiday at all. I don't think he's well.
I have been a great deal worried about
him," she added. Her face was bent over
the buttons of her glove, and when she
raised her blue eyes to Helen they were
filled with serious concern.
</p>

<p>
"Really," Helen stammered, "I&mdash;I
didn't know&mdash;in his letters he seemed very
cheerful."
</p>

<p>
Marion shook her head and turned and
stood looking thoughtfully out of the window.
"He's in a very hard place," she began
abruptly, and then stopped as though
she had thought better of what she intended
to say. Helen tried to ask her to
go on, but could not bring herself to do so.
She wanted to get away.
</p>

<p>
"I tell him he ought to leave London,"
Marion began again; "he needs a change
and a rest."
</p>

<p>
"I should think he might," Helen
agreed, "after three months of this heat.
He wrote me he intended going to Herne
Bay or over to Ostend."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he had meant to go," Marion
answered. She spoke with an air of one
who possessed the most intimate knowledge
of Carroll's movements and plans,
and change of plans. "But he couldn't,"
she added. "He couldn't afford it.
Helen," she said, turning to the other girl,
dramatically, "do you know&mdash;I believe
that Philip is very poor."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cabot exclaimed, incredulously,
"Poor!" she laughed. "Why, what do
you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that he has no money,"
Marion answered, sharply. "These rooms
represent nothing. He only keeps
them on because he paid for them in advance.
He's been living on three shillings
a day. That's poor for him. He takes
his meals at cabmen's shelters and at
Lockhart's, and he's been doing so for a
month."
</p>

<p>
Helen recalled with a guilty thrill the
receipt of certain boxes of La France
roses&mdash;cut long, in the American fashion&mdash;which
had arrived within the last month
at various country houses. She felt indignant
at herself, and miserable. Her
indignation was largely due to the recollection
that she had given these flowers to
her hostess to decorate the dinner-table.
</p>

<p>
She hated to ask this girl of things
which she should have known better than
anyone else. But she forced herself to
do it. She felt she must know certainly
and at once.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?" she asked.
"Are you sure there is no mistake?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me himself," said Marion,
"when he talked of letting the plays go
and returning to America. He said he
must go back; that his money was gone."
</p>

<p>
"He is gone to America!" Helen said,
blankly.
</p>

<p>
"No, he wanted to go, but I wouldn't
let him," Marion went on. "I told him
that someone might take his play any
day. And this third one he has written,
the one he finished this summer in town,
is the best of all, I think. It's a love-story.
It's quite beautiful." She turned
and arranged her veil at the glass, and as
she did so, her eyes fell on the photographs
of herself scattered over the mantel-piece,
and she smiled slightly. But
Helen did not see her&mdash;she was sitting
down now, pulling at the books on the
table. She was confused and disturbed
by emotions which were quite strange to
her, and when Marion bade her good-by
she hardly noticed her departure. What
impressed her most of all in what Marion
had told her, was, she was surprised to find,
that Philip was going away. That she
herself had frequently urged him to do
so, for his own peace of mind, seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
now of no consequence. Now that he
seriously contemplated it, she recognized
that his absence meant to her a change in
everything. She felt for the first time
the peculiar place he held in her life.
Even if she had seen him but seldom, the
fact that he was within call had been
more of a comfort and a necessity to her
than she understood.
</p>

<p>
That he was poor, concerned her chiefly
because she knew that, although this condition
could only be but temporary, it
would distress him not to have his friends
around him, and to entertain them as he
had been used to do. She wondered
eagerly if she might offer to help him, but
a second thought assured her that, for a
man, that sort of help from a woman was
impossible.
</p>

<p>
She resented the fact that Marion was
deep in his confidence; that it was Marion
who had told her of his changed condition
and of his plans. It annoyed her
so acutely that she could not remain in
the room where she had seen her so complacently
in possession. And after leaving
a brief note for Philip, she went away.
She stopped a hansom at the door, and
told the man to drive along the Embankment&mdash;she
wanted to be quite alone, and
she felt she could see no one until she had
thought it all out, and had analyzed the
new feelings.
</p>

<p>
So for several hours she drove slowly
up and down, sunk far back in the cushions
of the cab, and staring, with unseeing
eyes, at the white enamelled tariff and
the black dash-board.
</p>

<p>
She assured herself that she was not
jealous of Marion, because, in order to be
jealous, she first would have to care for
Philip in the very way she could not
bring herself to do.
</p>

<p>
She decided that his interest in Marion
hurt her, because it showed that Philip
was not capable of remaining true to the
one ideal of his life. She was sure that
this explained her feelings&mdash;she was disappointed
that he had not kept up to his
own standard; that he was weak enough
to turn aside from it for the first pretty
pair of eyes. But she was too honest and
too just to accept that diagnosis of her
feelings as final&mdash;she knew there had been
many pairs of eyes in America and in
London, and that though Philip had seen
them, he had not answered them when
they spoke. No, she confessed frankly,
she was hurt with herself for neglecting
her old friend so selfishly and for so long
a time; his love gave him claims on
her consideration, at least, and she had
forgotten that and him, and had run
after strange gods and allowed others to
come in and take her place, and to give
him the sympathy and help which she
should have been the first to offer, and
which would have counted more when
coming from her than from anyone else.
She determined to make amends at once
for her thoughtlessness and selfishness,
and her brain was pleasantly occupied
with plans and acts of kindness. It was
a new entertainment, and she found she
delighted in it. She directed the cabman
to go to Solomons's, and from there sent
Philip a bunch of flowers and a line saying
that on the following day she was
coming to take tea with him. She had a
guilty feeling that he might consider her
friendly advances more seriously than she
meant them, but it was her pleasure to be
reckless: her feelings were running riotously,
and the sensation was so new that
she refused to be circumspect or to consider
consequences. Who could tell, she
asked herself with a quick, frightened gasp,
but that, after all, it might be that she was
learning to care? From Solomons's she
bade the man drive to the shop in Cranbourne
Street where she was accustomed
to purchase the materials she used in
painting, and Fate, which uses strange
agents to work out its ends, so directed it
that the cabman stopped a few doors below
this shop, and opposite one where
jewelry and other personal effects were
bought and sold. At any other time, or
had she been in any other mood, what
followed might not have occurred, but
Fate, in the person of the cabman, arranged
it so that the hour and the opportunity
came together.
</p>

<p>
There were some old mezzotints in the
window of the loan shop, a string of coins
and medals, a row of new French posters;
and far down to the front a tray filled with
gold and silver cigarette-cases and watches
and rings. It occurred to Helen, who was
still bent on making restitution for her neglect,
that a cigarette-case would be more
appropriate for a man than flowers, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
more lasting. And she scanned the contents
of the window with the eye of one
who now saw in everything only something
which might give Philip pleasure.
The two objects of value in the tray upon
which her eyes first fell were the gold seal-ring
with which Philip had sealed his letters
to her, and lying next to it, his gold
watch! There was something almost human
in the way the ring and watch spoke
to her from the past&mdash;in the way they appealed
to her to rescue them from the surroundings
to which they had been abandoned.
She did not know what she meant
to do with them nor how she could return
them to Philip; but there was no question
of doubt in her manner as she swept with
a rush into the shop. There was no attempt,
either, at bargaining in the way in
which she pointed out to the young woman
behind the counter the particular ring and
watch she wanted. They had not been
left as collateral, the young woman said;
they had been sold outright.
</p>

<p>
"Then anyone can buy them?" Helen
asked eagerly. "They are for sale to the
public&mdash;to anyone?"
</p>

<p>
The young woman made note of the
customer's eagerness, but with an unmoved
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss, they are for sale. The
ring is four pounds and the watch twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-nine pounds!" Helen gasped.
</p>

<p>
That was more money than she had in
the world, but the fact did not distress her,
for she had a true artistic disregard for
ready money, and the absence of it had
never disturbed her. But now it assumed
a sudden and alarming value. She had
ten pounds in her purse and ten pounds
at her studio&mdash;these were just enough to
pay for a quarter's rent and the rates, and
there was a hat and cloak in Bond Street
which she certainly must have. Her
only assets consisted of the possibility that
someone might soon order a miniature,
and to her mind that was sufficient. Some
one always had ordered a miniature, and
there was no reasonable doubt but that
someone would do it again. For a moment
she questioned if it would not be sufficient
if she bought the ring and allowed
the watch to remain. But she recognized
that the ring meant more to her than the
watch, while the latter, as an old heirloom
which had been passed down to him from
a great-grandfather, meant more to Philip.
It was for Philip she was doing this, she
reminded herself. She stood holding his
possessions, one in each hand, and looking
at the young woman blankly. She had
no doubt in her mind that at least part of
the money he had received for them had
paid for the flowers he had sent to her in
Scotland. The certainty of this left her
no choice. She laid the ring and watch
down and pulled the only ring she possessed
from her own finger. It was a gift
from Lady Gower. She had no doubt
that it was of great value.
</p>

<p>
"Can you lend me some money on
that?" she asked. It was the first time
she had conducted a business transaction
of this nature, and she felt as though she
were engaging in a burglary.
</p>

<p>
"We don't lend money, miss," the girl
said, "we buy outright. I can give you
twenty-eight shillings for this," she added.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-eight shillings," Helen gasped;
"why, it is worth&mdash;oh, ever so much more
than that!"
</p>

<p>
"That is all it is worth to us," the girl
answered. She regarded the ring indifferently
and laid it away from her on the
counter. The action was final.
</p>

<p>
Helen's hands rose slowly to her breast,
where a pretty watch dangled from a bow-knot
of crushed diamonds. It was her
only possession, and she was very fond of
it. It also was the gift of one of the several
great ladies who had adopted her
since her residence in London. Helen
had painted a miniature of this particular
great lady which had looked so beautiful
that the pleasure which the original of the
portrait derived from the thought that she
still really looked as she did in the miniature,
was worth more to her than many
diamonds.
</p>

<p>
But it was different with Helen, and no
one could count what it cost her to tear
away her one proud possession.
</p>

<p>
"What will you give me for this?" she
asked, defiantly.
</p>

<p>
The girl's eyes showed greater interest.
"I can give you twenty pounds for that,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Take it, please," Helen begged, as
though she feared if she kept it a moment
longer she might not be able to make the
sacrifice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That will be enough now," she went
on, taking out her ten-pound note. She
put Lady Gower's ring back upon her
finger and picked up Philip's ring and
watch with the pleasure of one who has
come into a great fortune. She turned
back at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she stammered, "in case anyone
should inquire, you are not to say
who bought these."
</p>

<p>
"No, miss, certainly not," said the
woman. Helen gave the direction to the
cabman and, closing the doors of the hansom,
sat looking down at the watch and
the ring as they lay in her lap. The
thought that they had been his most valued
possessions, which he had abandoned
forever, and that they were now entirely
hers, to do with as she liked, filled her
with most intense delight and pleasure.
She took up the heavy gold ring and
placed it on the little finger of her left
hand; it was much too large, and she removed
it and balanced it for a moment
doubtfully in the palm of her right hand.
She was smiling, and her face was lit with
shy and tender thoughts. She cast a
quick glance to the left and right, as
though fearful that people passing in the
street would observe her, and then slipped
the ring over the third finger of her left
hand. She gazed at it with a guilty smile
and then, covering it hastily with her other
hand, leaned back, clasping it closely, and
sat frowning far out before her with puzzled
eyes.
</p>

<p>
To Carroll all roads led past Helen's
studio, and during the summer, while she
had been absent in Scotland, it was one of
his sad pleasures to make a pilgrimage to
her street and to pause opposite the house
and look up at the empty windows of her
rooms. It was during this daily exercise
that he learned, through the arrival of her
luggage, of her return to London, and
when day followed day without her having
shown any desire to see him or to
tell him of her return he denounced himself
most bitterly as a fatuous fool.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the week he sat down and
considered his case quite calmly. For
three years he had loved this girl, deeply
and tenderly. He had been lover, brother,
friend, and guardian. During that time,
even though she had accepted him in
every capacity except as that of the prospective
husband, she had never given him
any real affection, nor sympathy, nor help;
all she had done for him had been done
without her knowledge or intent. To know
her, to love her, and to scheme to give her
pleasure had been its own reward, and the
only one. For the last few months he
had been living like a crossing-sweeper
in order to be able to stay in London until
she came back to it, and that he might
still send her the gifts he had always laid
on her altar. He had not seen her in three
months. Three months that had been to
him a blank, except for his work&mdash;which
like all else that he did, was inspired and carried
on for her. Now at last she had returned
and had shown that, even as a friend,
he was of so little account in her thoughts,
of so little consequence in her life, that
after this long absence she had no desire
to learn of his welfare or to see him&mdash;she
did not even give him the chance to see
her. And so, placing these facts before
him for the first time since he had loved
her, he considered what was due to himself.
"Was it good enough?" he asked.
"Was it just that he should continue to
wear out his soul and body for this girl
who did not want what he had to give,
who treated him less considerately than
a man whom she met for the first time at
dinner?" He felt he had reached the
breaking-point; that the time had come
when he must consider what he owed to
himself. There could never be any other
woman save Helen, but as it was not to
be Helen, he could no longer, with self-respect,
continue to proffer his love only
to see it slighted and neglected. He was
humble enough concerning himself, but of
his love he was very proud. Other men
could give her more in wealth or position,
but no one could ever love her as he did.
"He that hath more let him give," he had
often quoted to her defiantly, as though
he were challenging the world, and now
he felt he must evolve a make-shift world
of his own&mdash;a world in which she was not
his only spring of acts; he must begin all
over again and keep his love secret and
sacred until she understood it and wanted
it. And if she should never want it he
would at least have saved it from many
rebuffs and insults.
</p>

<p>
With this determination strong in him,
the note Helen had left for him after her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
talk with Marion, and the flowers, and the
note with them, saying she was coming to
take tea on the morrow, failed to move
him except to make him more bitter. He
saw in them only a tardy recognition of
her neglect&mdash;an effort to make up to him
for thoughtlessness which, from her, hurt
him worse than studied slight.
</p>

<p>
A new régime had begun, and he was
determined to establish it firmly and to
make it impossible for himself to retreat
from it; and in the note in which he thanked
Helen for the flowers and welcomed her
to tea, he declared his ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
"You know how terribly I feel," he
wrote; "I don't have to tell you that, but
I cannot always go on dragging out my
love and holding it up to excite your pity
as beggars show their sores. I cannot always
go on praying before your altar, cutting
myself with knives and calling upon
you to listen to me. You know that there
is no one else but you, and that there
never can be anyone but you, and that
nothing is changed except that after this
I am not going to urge and torment you.
I shall wait as I have always waited&mdash;only
now I shall wait in silence. You
know just how little, in one way, I have to
offer you, and you know just how much I
have in love to offer you. It is now for
you to speak&mdash;some day, or never. But
you will have to speak first. You will
never hear a word of love from me again.
Why should you? You know it is always
waiting for you. But if you should ever
want it, you must come to me, and take
off your hat and put it on my table and say,
'Philip, I have come to stay.' Whether
you can ever do that or not can make
no difference in my love for you. I shall
love you always, as no man has ever
loved a woman in this world, but it is you
who must speak first; for me, the rest is
silence."
</p>

<p>
The following morning as Helen was
leaving the house she found this letter
lying on the hall-table, and ran back with
it to her rooms. A week before she would
have let it lie on the table and read it
on her return. She was conscious that
this was what she would have done, and
it pleased her to find that what concerned
Philip was now to her the thing of greatest
interest. She was pleased with her
own eagerness&mdash;her own happiness was a
welcome sign, and she was proud and
glad that she was learning to care.
</p>

<p>
She read the letter with an anxious
pride and pleasure in each word that was
entirely new. Philip's recriminations did
not hurt her, they were the sign that he
cared; nor did his determination not to
speak of his love to her hurt her, for she
believed him when he said that he would
always care. She read the letter twice,
and then sat for some time considering
the kind of letter Philip would have written
had he known her secret&mdash;had he
known that the ring he had abandoned
was now upon her finger.
</p>

<p>
She rose and, crossing to a desk, placed
the letter in a drawer, and then took it out
again and re-read the last page. When
she had finished it she was smiling. For
a moment she stood irresolute and then,
moving slowly toward the centre-table,
cast a guilty look about her and, raising
her hands, lifted her veil and half withdrew
the pins that fastened her hat.
</p>

<p>
"Philip," she began in a frightened
whisper, "I have&mdash;I have come to&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
The sentence ended in a cry of protest,
and she rushed across the room as
though she were running from herself.
She was blushing violently.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" she cried, as she pulled open
the door; "I could never do it&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
The following afternoon, when Helen
was to come to tea, Carroll decided that
he would receive her with all the old
friendliness, but that he must be careful to
subdue all emotion.
</p>

<p>
He was really deeply hurt at her treatment,
and had it not been that she came
on her own invitation he would not of his
own accord have sought to see her. In
consequence, he rather welcomed than
otherwise the arrival of Marion Cavendish,
who came a half-hour before Helen
was expected, and who followed a hasty
knock with a precipitate entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," she commanded breathlessly;
"and listen. I've been at rehearsal
all day, or I'd have been here before
you were awake." She seated herself
nervously and nodded her head at Carroll
in an excited and mysterious manner.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he asked. "Have you
and Reggie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-018.jpg" width="360" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Saw her staring down at the tumult.&mdash;<a href="#Page_150">Page 150</a>.
</p></div>

<p>
"Listen," Marion repeated, "our fortunes
are made; that is what's the matter&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
I've made them. If you took half
the interest in your work I do, you'd have
made yours long ago. Last night," she
began, impressively, "I went to a large
supper at the Savoy, and I sat next to
Charley Wimpole. He came in late, after
everybody had finished, and I attacked
him while he was eating his supper. He
said he had been rehearsing 'Caste' after
the performance; that they've put it
on as a stop-gap on account of the failure
of the 'Triflers,' and that he knew
revivals were of no use; that he would
give any sum for a good modern comedy.
That was my cue, and I told him
I knew of a better comedy than any
he had produced at his theatre in five
years, and that it was going begging. He
laughed, and asked where was he to find
this wonderful comedy, and I said, 'It's
been in your safe for the last two months,
and you haven't read it.' He said 'Indeed,
how do you know that?' and I said,
'Because if you'd read it, it wouldn't be
in your safe, but on your stage.' So, he
asked me what the play was about, and I
told him the plot and what sort of a part
his was, and some of his scenes, and he
began to take notice. He forgot his supper,
and very soon he grew so interested
that he turned his chair round and kept
eying my supper-card to find out who I
was, and at last remembered seeing me in
'The New Boy'&mdash;and a rotten part it was,
too&mdash;but he remembered it, and he told me
to go on and tell him more about your play.
So I recited it, bit by bit, and he laughed
in all the right places and got very much
excited, and said finally that he would
read it the first thing this morning."
Marion paused, breathlessly. "Oh, yes,
and he wrote your address on his cuff,"
she added, with the air of delivering a
complete and convincing climax.
</p>

<p>
Carroll stared at her and pulled excitedly
on his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Marion!" he gasped, "suppose
he should? He won't, though," he added,
but eying her eagerly and inviting
contradiction.
</p>

<p>
"He will," she answered, stoutly, "if
he reads it."
</p>

<p>
"The other managers read it," Carroll
suggested, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but what do they know?" Marion
returned, loftily. "He knows. Charles
Wimpole is the only intelligent actor-manager
in London."
</p>

<p>
There was a sharp knock at the door,
which Marion in her excitement had left
ajar, and Prentiss threw it wide open
with an impressive sweep, as though he
were announcing royalty; "Mr. Charles
Wimpole," he said.
</p>

<p>
The actor-manager stopped in the
doorway bowing gracefully, his hat held
before him and his hand on his stick as
though it were resting on a foil. He had
the face and carriage of a gallant of the
days of Congreve, and he wore his modern
frock-coat with as much distinction
as if it were of silk and lace. He was
evidently amused. "I couldn't help over-hearing
the last line," he said, smiling.
"It gives me a good entrance."
</p>

<p>
Marion gazed at him blankly: "Oh,"
she gasped, "we&mdash;we&mdash;were just talking
about you."
</p>

<p>
"If you hadn't mentioned my name,"
the actor said, "I should never have
guessed it. And this is Mr. Carroll, I
hope."
</p>

<p>
The great man was rather pleased with
the situation. As he read it, it struck
him as possessing strong dramatic possibilities:
Carroll was the struggling author
on the verge of starvation: Marion, his
sweetheart, flying to him gave him hope;
and he was the good fairy arriving in the
nick of time to set everything right and
to make the young people happy and
prosperous. He rather fancied himself
in the part of the good fairy, and as he
seated himself he bowed to them both in
a manner which was charmingly inclusive
and confidential.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Cavendish, I imagine, has already
warned you that you might expect a visit
from me," he said, tentatively. Carroll
nodded. He was too much concerned
to interrupt.
</p>

<p>
"Then I need only tell you," Wimpole
continued, "that I got up at an absurd
hour this morning to read your play; that
I did read it; that I like it immensely&mdash;and
that if we can come to terms I shall
produce it. I shall produce it at once,
within a fortnight or three weeks."

<p>
Carroll was staring at him intently and
continued doing so after Wimpole had finished
speaking. The actor felt he had
somehow missed his point, or that Carroll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'></a></span>

could not have understood him, and repeated,
"I say I shall put it in rehearsal
at once."
</p>

</p></div>

<p>
Carroll rose abruptly, and pushed back
his chair. "I should be very glad," he
murmured, and strode over to the window,
where he stood with his back turned to
his guests. Wimpole looked after him
with a kindly smile and nodded his head
appreciatively. He had produced even a
greater effect than his lines seemed to warrant.
When he spoke again, it was quite
simply and sincerely, and though he spoke
for Carroll's benefit, he addressed himself
to Marion.
</p>

<p>
"You were quite right last night," he
said, "it is a most charming piece of work.
I am really extremely grateful to you for
bringing it to my notice." He rose, and
going to Carroll, put his hand on his
shoulder. "My boy," he said, "I congratulate
you. I should like to be your
age, and to have written that play. Come
to my theatre to-morrow and we will talk
terms. Talk it over first with your friends,
so that I sha'n't rob you. Do you think
you would prefer a lump sum now, and
so be done with it altogether, or trust that
the royalties may&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Royalties," prompted Marion, in an
eager aside.
</p>

<p>
The men laughed. "Quite right,"
Wimpole assented, good-humoredly; "it's
a poor sportsman who doesn't back his
own horse. Well then, until to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"But," Carroll began, "one moment
please. I haven't thanked you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," cried Wimpole, waving
him away with his stick, "it is I who
have to thank you."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and there is a condition," Carroll
said, "which goes with the play. It
is that Miss Cavendish is to have the part
of <i>Nancy</i>."
</p>

<p>
Wimpole looked serious and considered
for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nancy</i>," he said, "the girl who interferes&mdash;a
very good part. I have cast
Miss Maddox for it in my mind, but, of
course, if the author insists&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Marion, with her elbows on the table,
clasped her hands appealingly before her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Wimpole!" she cried, "you
owe me that, at least."
</p>

<p>
Carroll leaned over and took both of
Marion's hands in one of his.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he said; "the author insists."
</p>

<p>
Wimpole waved his stick again as
though it were the magic wand of the good
fairy.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have it," he said. "I recall
your performance in 'The New Boy'
with pleasure. I take the play, and Miss
Cavendish shall be cast for <i>Nancy</i>. We
shall begin rehearsals at once. I hope
you are a quick study."
</p>

<p>
"I'm letter-perfect now," laughed
Marion.
</p>

<p>
Wimpole turned at the door and nodded
to them. They were both so young,
so eager, and so jubilant that he felt
strangely old and out of it. "Good-by,
then," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, sir," they both chorused.
And Marion cried after him, "And thank
you a thousand times."
</p>

<p>
He turned again and looked back at
them, but in their rejoicing they had already
forgotten him. "Bless you, my
children," he said, smiling. As he was
about to close the door a young girl came
down the passage toward it, and as she
was apparently going to Carroll's rooms,
the actor left the door open behind him.
</p>

<p>
Neither Marion nor Carroll had noticed
his final exit. They were both gazing at
each other as though, could they find
speech, they would ask if it were true.
</p>

<p>
"It's come at last, Marion," Philip said,
with an uncertain voice.
</p>

<p>
"I could weep," cried Marion. "Philip,"
she exclaimed, "I would rather see
that play succeed than any play ever written,
and I would rather play that part in
it than&mdash;Oh, Philip," she ended. "I'm
so proud of you!" and rising, she threw
her arms about his neck and sobbed on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Carroll raised one of her hands and
kissed the tips of her fingers, gently. "I
owe it to you, Marion," he said&mdash;"all to
you."
</p>

<p>
This was the tableau that was presented
through the open door to Miss Helen
Cabot, hurrying on her errand of restitution
and good-will, and with Philip's ring and
watch clasped in her hand. They had not
heard her, nor did they see her at the
door, so she drew back quickly and ran
along the passage and down the stairs into
the street.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She did not need now to analyze her
feelings. They were only too evident.
For she could translate what she had just
seen as meaning only one thing&mdash;that she
had considered Philip's love so lightly that
she had not felt it passing away from her
until her neglect had killed it&mdash;until it was
too late. And now that it was too late
she felt that without it her life could not
go on. She tried to assure herself that
only the fact that she had lost it made it
seem invaluable, but this thought did not
comfort her&mdash;she was not deceived by it,
she knew that at last she cared for him
deeply and entirely. In her distress she
blamed herself bitterly, but she also blamed
Philip no less bitterly for having failed to
wait for her. "He might have known
that I must love him in time," she repeated
to herself again and again. She was so
unhappy that her letter congratulating
Philip on his good fortune in having his
comedy accepted seemed to him cold and
unfeeling, and as his success meant for him
only what it meant to her, he was hurt and
grievously disappointed.
</p>

<p>
He accordingly turned the more readily
to Marion, whose interests and enthusiasm
at the rehearsals of the piece seemed in
contrast most friendly and unselfish. He
could not help but compare the attitude
of the two girls at this time, when the failure
or success of his best work was still
undecided. He felt that as Helen took so
little interest in his success he could not
dare to trouble her with his anxieties concerning
it, and she attributed his silence
to his pre-occupation and interest in
Marion. So the two grew apart, each misunderstanding
the other and each troubled
in spirit at the other's indifference.
</p>

<p>
The first night of the play justified all
that Marion and Wimpole had claimed for
it, and was a great personal triumph for
the new playwright. The audience was
the typical first-night audience of the class
which Charles Wimpole always commanded.
It was brilliant, intelligent, and smart,
and it came prepared to be pleased.
</p>

<p>
From one of the upper stage-boxes Helen
and Lady Gower watched the successful
progress of the play with an anxiety
almost as keen as that of the author. To
Helen it seemed as though the giving of
these lines to the public&mdash;these lines
which he had so often read to her, and
altered to her liking&mdash;was a desecration.
It seemed as though she were losing
him indeed&mdash;as though he now belonged
to these strange people, all of whom
were laughing and applauding his words,
from the German Princess in the Royal
box to the straight-backed Tommy in
the pit. Instead of the painted scene
before her, she saw the birch-trees by the
river at home, where he had first read her
the speech to which they were now listening
so intensely&mdash;the speech in which the
hero tells the girl he loves her. She remembered
that at the time she had
thought how wonderful it would be if some
day someone made such a speech to her&mdash;not Philip&mdash;but
a man she loved. And
now? If Philip would only make that
speech to her now!
</p>

<p>
He came out at last, with Wimpole leading
him, and bowed across a glaring barrier
of lights at a misty but vociferous
audience that was shouting the generous
English bravo! and standing up to applaud.
He raised his eyes to the box
where Helen sat and saw her staring
down at the tumult, with her hands clasped
under her chin. Her face was colorless,
but lit with the excitement of the moment;
and he saw that she was crying.
</p>

<p>
Lady Gower, from behind her, was
clapping her hands delightedly.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Helen," she remonstrated,
breathlessly, "you never told me he
was so good-looking."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Helen, rising abruptly, "he
is&mdash;very good-looking."
</p>

<p>
She crossed the box to where her cloak
was hanging, but instead of taking it down
buried her face in its folds.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child!" cried Lady Gower
in dismay. "What is it? The excitement
has been too much for you."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am just happy," sobbed Helen.
"I am just happy for him."
</p>

<p>
"We will go and tell him so then," said
Lady Gower. "I am sure he would like
to hear it from you to-night."
</p>

<p>
Philip was standing in the centre of the
stage, surrounded by many pretty ladies
and elderly men. Wimpole was hovering
over him as though he had claims upon
him by the right of discovery.
</p>

<p>
But when Philip saw Helen, he pushed
his way toward her eagerly and took her
hand in both of his.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad, Phil," she said. She felt
it all so deeply that she was afraid to say
more, but that meant so much to her that
she was sure he would understand.
</p>

<p>
He had planned it very differently.
For a year he had dreamed that, on the
first night of his play, there would be a
supper, and that he would rise and drink
her health, and tell his friends and the
world that she was the woman he loved,
and that she had agreed to marry him,
and that at last he was able, through the
success of his play, to make her his wife.
</p>

<p>
And now they met in a crowd to shake
hands, and she went her way with one of
her grand ladies, and he was left among a
group of chattering strangers. The great
English playwright took him by the hand
and in the hearing of all, praised him
gracefully and kindly. It did not matter
to Philip whether the older playwright
believed what he said or not; he knew it
was generously meant.
</p>

<p>
"I envy you this," the great man was
saying. "Don't lose any of it, stay and
listen to all they have to say. You will
never live through the first night of your
first play but once."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I hear them," said Philip, nervously;
"they are all too kind. But I
don't hear the voice I have been listening
for," he added in a whisper. The older
man pressed his hand again quickly.
"My dear boy," he said, "I am sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," Philip answered.
</p>

<p>
Within a week he had forgotten the
great man's fine words of praise, but the
clasp of his hand he cherished always.
</p>

<p>
Helen met Marion as she was leaving
the stage-door and stopped to congratulate
her on her success in the new part.
Marion was radiant. To Helen she seemed
obstreperously happy and jubilant.
</p>

<p>
"And Marion," Helen began, bravely,
"I also want to congratulate you on something
else. You&mdash;you&mdash;neither of you have
told me yet," she stammered, "but I am
such an old friend of both that I will not
be kept out of the secret." At these words
Marion's air of triumphant gayety vanished;
she regarded Helen's troubled eyes
closely and kindly.
</p>

<p>
"What secret, Helen?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I came to the door of Philip's room
the other day when you did not know I
was there," Helen answered; "and I
could not help seeing how matters were.
And I do congratulate you both&mdash;&mdash;and
wish you&mdash;oh, such happiness!" Without
a word Marion dragged her back down
the passage to her dressing-room, and
closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me what you mean," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry if I discovered anything
you didn't want known yet," said Helen,
"but the door was open. Mr. Wimpole
had just left you and had not shut it, and
I could not help seeing."
</p>

<p>
Marion interrupted her with an eager
exclamation of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you were there, then," she cried.
"And you?" she asked eagerly&mdash;"you
thought Phil cared for me&mdash;that we are
engaged, and it hurt you; you are sorry?
Tell me," she demanded, "are you sorry?"
</p>

<p>
Helen drew back and stretched out her
hand toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"How can you!" she exclaimed, indignantly.
"You have no right."
</p>

<p>
Marion stood between her and the door.
</p>

<p>
"I have every right," she said, "to
help my friends, and I want to help you
and Philip. And indeed I do hope you
<i>are</i> sorry. I hope you are miserable.
And I'm glad you saw me kiss him. That
was the first and the last time, and I did
it because I was happy and glad for him;
and because I love him too, but not in
the least in the way he loves you. No
one ever loved anyone as he loves you.
And it's time you found it out. And if I
have helped to make you find it out I'm
glad, and I don't care how much I hurt
you."
</p>

<p>
"Marion!" exclaimed Helen, "what
does it mean? Do you mean that you
are not engaged; that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," Marion answered. "I
am going to marry Reggie. It is you that
Philip loves, and I am very sorry for you
that you don't love him."
</p>

<p>
Helen clasped Marion's hands in both
of hers.
</p>

<p>
"But, Marion!" she cried, "I do, oh,
I do!"
</p>

<p class="p2">
There was a thick yellow fog the next
morning, and with it rain and a sticky, depressing
dampness which crept through the
window-panes, and which neither a fire
nor blazing gas-jets could overcome.
</p>

<p>
Philip stood in front of the fire-place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
with the morning papers piled high on the
centre-table and scattered over the room
about him.
</p>

<p>
He had read them all, and he knew
now what it was to wake up famous, but
he could not taste it. Now that it had
come it meant nothing, and that it was so
complete a triumph only made it the harder.
In his most optimistic dreams he had
never imagined success so satisfying as the
reality had proved to be; but in his dreams
Helen had always held the chief part, and
without her success seemed only to mock
him.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to lay it all before her, to
say, "If you are pleased, I am happy. If
you are satisfied, then I am content. It
was done for you, and I am wholly yours,
and all that I do is yours." And, as though
in answer to his thoughts, there was an
instant knock at the door, and Helen entered
the room and stood smiling at him
across the table.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were lit with excitement, and
spoke with many emotions, and her cheeks
were brilliant with color. He had never
seen her look more beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Helen!" he exclaimed, "how
good of you to come. Is there anything
wrong? Is anything the matter?"
</p>

<p>
She tried to speak, but faltered, and
smiled at him appealingly.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he asked in great concern.
</p>

<p>
Helen drew in her breath quickly, and at
the same moment motioned him away&mdash;and
he stepped back and stood watching
her in much perplexity.
</p>

<p>
With her eyes fixed on his she raised
her hands to her head, and her fingers
fumbled with the knot of her veil. She
pulled it loose, and then, with a sudden
courage, lifted her hat proudly, as though
it were a coronet, and placed it between
them on his table.
</p>

<p>
"Philip," she stammered, with the tears
in her voice and eyes, "if you will let
me&mdash;I have come to stay."
</p>

<p>
The table was no longer between them.
He caught her in his arms and kissed her
face and her uncovered head again and
again. From outside the rain beat drearily
and the fog rolled through the street,
but inside before the fire the two young
people sat close together, asking eager
questions or sitting in silence, staring at
the flames with wondering, happy eyes.
</p>

<p class="p2">

The Lion and the Unicorn saw them
only once again. It was a month later
when they stopped in front of the shop in
a four-wheeler, with their baggage mixed
on top of it, and steamer-labels pasted
over every trunk.
</p>

<p>
"And, oh, Prentiss!" Carroll called
from the cab-window. "I came near
forgetting. I promised to gild the Lion
and the Unicorn if I won out in London.
So have it done, please, and send the bill
to me. For I've won out all right."
And then he shut the door of the cab,
and they drove away forever.
</p>

<p>
"Nice gal, that," growled the Lion.
"I always liked her. I am glad they've
settled it at last."
</p>

<p>
The Unicorn sighed, sentimentally,
"The other one's worth two of her," he
said.

"That was truly his name, M'sieu'&mdash;Raoul
Vaillantcœur&mdash;a name of the fine
sound, is it not? But me&mdash;I think sometimes
those grand names attach themselves
not to the proper men. It is like the time
when the guide-post of the four roads,
beside Chicoutimi, blows down from the
big storm, and Telesphore Gauthier, he
sets him up once more. That Telesphore
there, he knows not to read, not so much
as the fool caribou. It is the mercy of
God, now, what road you take, unless
you know him already."
</p>

<p>
Silence for a few moments, broken only
by the ripple of water under the bow of
the canoe, the <i>slish</i>, <i>slish</i> of the dripping
paddle at the stern, and the persistent
patter of the rain all around us. I knew
there was a story on the way. But I must
keep still to get it. A single ill-advised
question might switch it off the track into
a morass of politics or moralizing. Presently
the voice behind me began again.
</p>

<p>
"You like that name, M'sieu', is it not?
<i>Le cœur vaillant</i>&mdash;it pleases you. But my
faith! To me it seems that was given by
one who knows not to read. It was put
upon the wrong man, without doubt. You
shall judge for yourself, M'sieu', when you
hear what passed between this Vaillantcœur
and his friend Prosper Leclère at the
building of the church of Abbéville. You
remind yourself of that grand stone church
of the square tower&mdash;yes? Well, I am
going to tell you the story of that."
</p>

<p>
Thus Ferdinand, my brave <i>voyageur</i>, in
his old-fashioned <i>patois</i> of French Canada,
as he pushed the birch-bark down the lonely
length of Lac Moïse. How it rained that
day! The surface of the lake was beaten
flat, and quivered under the storm of silver
bullets. Waving sheets of watery
gray were driven before the wind; broad
curves of dancing drops swept along in
front of them where they touched the
lake. The dismal clouds had collapsed on
the mountains. All around the homeless
shores the evergreen trees seemed to hunch
their backs and stand closer together in
patient misery. Not a bird dared to sing&mdash;not
even a red-breasted crossbill.
</p>

<p>
It felt as if we were a thousand miles
from everywhere and everybody. Cities,
factories, libraries, colleges, laws, palaces,
theatres, temples&mdash;what had we dreamed
of these things? They were far off, in
another world. We had slipped back, who
knows how many centuries, into a primitive
life, and Ferdinand was telling me the
naked story of the brave heart, even as it
has been told from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
I cannot tell the story just as he did.
There was a charm in his speech too quick
for the pen: a flavor of fresh-cut pine
logs and clean wood-smoke, that is not to
be found in any ink for sale in the shops.
Perhaps he left out something that belongs
to the tale, and that I may be fool enough
to put in. But it shall be as little as
possible. The spirit of the tale shall be
his. It is Ferdinand's story. If you care
for the real thing, here it is. You shall
hear the difference between being called
Vaillantcœur and having <i>le cœur vaillant</i>.

II
</h3>

<p>
There were two young men in Abbéville
who were easily the cocks of the
woodland walk. Their eminence rested
on the fact that they were the strongest
men in the parish. Strength is the thing
that counts, when people live on the edge
of the wilderness. These two were well
known all through the country between
Lake St. John and Chicoutimi as men of
great capacity. Either of them could
shoulder a barrel of flour and walk off with
it as lightly as a common man would carry
a side of bacon. There was not a half-pound
of difference between them in ability.
But there was a great difference in
their looks and in their way of doing things.

<p>
Raoul Vaillantcœur was the biggest and
the handsomest man in the village; nearly
six feet tall, straight as a fir-tree, and black
as a bull-moose in December. He had natural
force enough and to spare. Whatever
he did was done by sheer power of
back and arm. He could send a canoe
up against the heaviest water, provided he
did not get mad and break his paddle&mdash;which
he usually did. He had more muscle
than he knew how to use.
</p>

<p>
Prosper Leclère did not have so much,
but he knew better how to handle it. He
never broke his paddle&mdash;unless it happened
to be a bad one, and then he generally
had another all ready in the canoe.
He was at least six inches shorter than
Vaillantcœur; broad shoulders, long arms,
light hair, gray eyes; not a handsome fellow,
but pleasant looking and very quiet.
What he did was done more than half with
his head.
</p>

<p>
Leclère was the kind of a man that never
needs more than one match to light a fire.
</p>

<p>
But Vaillantcœur&mdash;well, if the wood
was wet he might use a dozen, and when
the blaze was kindled, as like as not, he
would throw in the rest of the box.
</p>

<p>
Now, these two men had been friends
and were rivals. At least that was the way
that one of them looked at it. And most
of the people in the parish seemed to think
that was the right view.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange thing, and not altogether
satisfactory to the public mind, to have <i>two</i>
strongest men in the village. The question
of comparative standing in the community
ought to be raised and settled in
the usual way. Raoul was perfectly willing,
and at times (commonly on Saturday
nights) very eager. But Prosper was not.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, one March night, when
he was boiling maple-sap in the sugar-bush
with little Ovide Rossigno (who had a lyric
passion for holding the coat while another
man was fighting)&mdash;"no, for what shall I
fight with Raoul? As boys we have played
together. Once, in the rapids of <i>la Belle
Rivière</i>, when I have fallen in the water,
I think he has saved my life. He was
stronger, then, than me. I am always a
friend to him. If I beats him now, am I
stronger? No, but weaker. And if he
beats me, what is the sense of that? Certainly
I shall not like it. What is to gain?"
</p>

<p>
Down in the store of old Girard, that
night, Vaillantcœur was holding forth after
a different fashion. He stood among the
cracker-boxes and flour-barrels, with a
background of shelves laden with bright-colored
calicoes, and a line of tin pails
hanging overhead, and stated his view of
the case with vigor. He even pulled off
his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve to
show the knotty arguments with which he
proposed to clinch his opinion.
</p>

<p>
"That Leclère," said he, "that little
Prosper Leclère! He thinks himself one
of the strongest&mdash;a fine fellow! But I tell
you he is <i>lâche</i>. If he is clever? Yes.
But he is a poltroon. He knows well that
I can flatten him out like a <i>crêpe</i> in the frying-pan.
But he is afraid. He has not as
much courage as the musk-rat. You stamp
on the bank. He dives. He swims away.
Bah!"
</p>

<p>
"How about that time he cut loose the
jam of logs in the Rapide des Cédres?"
said old Girard from his corner.
</p>

<p>
Vaillantcœur's black eyes sparkled and
he twirled his mustache fiercely. "<i>Sa-prie!</i>"
he cried, "that was nothing! Any
man with an axe can cut a log. But to
fight&mdash;that is another affair. That demands
the brave heart. The strong man
who will not fight is a coward. Some day
I will put him through the mill&mdash;you shall
see what that small Leclère is made of,
<i>sacrédam!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Of course, affairs had not come to this
pass all at once. It was a long history,
beginning with the time when the two boys
had played together, and Raoul was twice
as strong as the other, and was very proud
of it. Prosper did not care; it was all
right so long as they had a good time. But
then Prosper began to do things better and
better. Raoul did not understand it; he
was jealous. Why should he not always
be the leader? He had more force.
Why should Prosper get ahead? Why
should he have better luck at the fishing
and the hunting and the farming? It
was by some trick. There was no justice
in it.
</p>

<p>
Raoul was not afraid of anything but
death; and whatever he wanted, he
thought he had a right to have. But he
did not know very well how to get it. He
would start to chop a log just at the spot
where there was a big knot. He was the
kind of a man that sets hare-snares on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
caribou-trail, and
then curses his luck
because he catches
nothing.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-030.jpg" width="402" height="550" alt="Man in a Tree" />
</div>

<p>
Besides, what ever
he did, he was always
thinking most about
beating somebody
else. But Prosper
cared most for doing
the thing as well as
he could. If anyone
else could beat him&mdash;well,
what difference
did it make? He would
do better the next time.
</p>

<p>
He looked the log over for a
clear place before he began to
chop. What he wanted was, not
to make the chips fly, but to get
the fire started.
</p>

<p>
You are not to suppose that
the one man was a saint and a
hero, and the other a fool and a ruffian.
No; that sort of thing happens only in
books. People in Abbéville were not
made on that plan. They were both plain
men. But there was a difference between
them; and out of that difference grew all
the trouble.
</p>

<p>
It was hard on Vaillantcœur, of course,
to see Leclère going ahead, getting rich,
clearing off the mortgage on his farm,
laying up money with the <i>notaire</i> Bergeron,
who acted as banker for the
parish&mdash;it was hard to look on at this,
while he himself stood still, or even
slipped back a little, got into debt, had
to sell a bit of the land that his father
left him. There must be some <i>chicane</i>
about it.
</p>

<p>
But this was not the hardest morsel
to swallow. The great thing that stuck
in his crop was the idea that the little
Prosper, whom he could have whipped so
easily, and whom he had protected so loftily,
when they were boys, now stood just as
high as he did as a capable man&mdash;perhaps
even higher. Why was it that when the
Pearce Brothers, down at Chicoutimi, had
a good "<i>jobbe-de-chantier</i>" up in the
woods on <i>la Belle Rivière</i>, they made
Leclère the boss, instead of Vaillantcœur?
Why did the <i>curé</i> Villeneuve choose Prosper,
and not Raoul, to steady the strain of
the biggest pole when they were setting
up the derrick for the building of the new
church?
</p>

<p>
It was rough, rough! The more Raoul
thought of it, the rougher it seemed. The
fact that it was a man who had once been
his <i>protégé</i>, and still insisted on being his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
best friend, did not make it any smoother.
Would you have liked it any better on that
account? I am not telling you how it
ought to have been, I am telling you how
it was. This isn't Vaillantcœur's account-book;
it's his story. You must strike
your balances as you go along.
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">"Why so many ifs in this fine speech?"&mdash;<a href="#Page_160">Page 160</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
And all the time, you understand, he
felt sure in his heart that he was stronger
and braver than Prosper. He was hungry
to prove it. He only knew of one
way. He grew more and more keen to
try it. Two or three things happened to
set an edge on his hunger.
</p>

<p>
The first was the affair at the shanty
on <i>Lac des Caps</i>. The wood-choppers,
like sailors, have a way of putting a new
man through a few tricks to initiate him
into the camp. Leclère was bossing the
job, with a gang of ten men
from St. Raymond under him.
Vaillantcœur had just driven
a team in over the snow with
a load of provisions, and was
lounging around the camp as
if it belonged to him. It was
Sunday afternoon, the regular
time for fun, but no one dared
to take hold of him. He
looked too big. He expressed
his opinion of the camp.
</p>

<p>
"No fun in this <i>chantier</i>,
<i>hé</i>? I suppose that little Leclère
he makes you others
work, and say your prayers,
and then, for the rest you can
sleep. <i>Hé!</i> Well, I am going
to prepare a little fun for you,
my boys. Come, Prosper, get
your hat, if you are able to
climb a tree."
</p>

<p>
He snatched the hat from
the table by the stove and ran
out into the snow. In front
of the shanty a good-sized
spruce, tall, smooth, very
straight, was still standing. He
went up the trunk like a bear.
</p>

<p>
But there was a dead balsam that had
fallen against the spruce and lodged on
the lower branches. It was barely strong
enough to bear the weight of a light man.
Up this slanting ladder Prosper ran quickly
in his moccasined feet, snatched the
hat from Raoul's teeth as he swarmed up
the trunk, and ran down again. As he
neared the ground, the balsam, shaken from
its lodgement, cracked and fell. Raoul
was left up the tree, perched among the
branches, out of breath. Luck had set the
scene for the lumberman's favorite trick.
</p>

<p>
"Chop him down! chop him down!"
was the cry; and a trio of axes were
twanging against the spruce-tree, while
the other men shouted and laughed and
pelted the tree with ice to keep the prisoner
from climbing down.
</p>



<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-032.jpg" width="352" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">They looked fine on Corpus Christi day.&mdash;<a href="#Page_162">Page 162</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Prosper neither shouted nor chopped,
but he grinned a little as he watched the
tree quiver and shake, and heard the rain
of "<i>sacrés!</i>" and "<i>maudits!</i>" that came
out of the swaying top. He grinned&mdash;until
he saw that a half-dozen more blows
would fell the spruce right on the roof of
the shanty.
</p>

<p>
"Are you fools?" he cried, as he
picked up an axe; "you know nothing
how to chop. You kill a man. You
smash the <i>cabane</i>. Let go!" He shoved
one of the boys away and sent a score of
mighty cuts into the side of the spruce
that was farthest from the cabin; then
two short cuts on the other side; the tree
shivered, staggered, cracked, and swept
in a great arc toward the deep snow-drift
by the brook. As the top swung earth-ward,
Raoul jumped clear of the crashing
branches and landed safely in the featherbed
of snow, buried up to his neck. Nothing
was to be seen of him but his head,
like some new kind of fire-work&mdash;sputtering
bad words.
</p>

<p>
Well, this was the first thing that put
an edge on Vaillantcœur's hunger to fight.
No man likes to be chopped down by his
friend, even if the friend does it for the
sake of saving him from being killed by a
fall on the shanty-roof. It is easy to forget
that part of it. What you remember
is the grin.
</p>

<p>
The second thing that made it worse
was the bad chance that both of these
men had to fall in love with the same
girl. Of course there were other girls in
the village besides Marie Antoinette Girard&mdash;plenty
of them, and good girls, too.
But somehow or other, when they <i>were
beside her</i>, neither Raoul nor Prosper
cared to look at any of them, but only at
'Toinette. Her eyes were so much darker
and her cheeks so much more red&mdash;bright
as the berries of the mountain-ash in September.
Her hair hung down to her
waist on Sunday in two long braids, brown
and shiny like a ripe hazel-nut; and her
voice when she laughed made the sound
of water tumbling over little stones.
</p>

<p>
No one knew which of the two lovers
she liked best. At school it was certainly
Raoul, because he was bigger and bolder.
When she came back from her year in
the convent at Roberval it was certainly
Prosper, because he could talk better and
had read more books. He had a volume
of <i>chansons</i> full of love and romance, and
knew most of them by heart. But this
did not last forever. 'Toinette's manners
had been polished at the convent, but her
ideas were still those of her own people.
She never thought that knowledge of
books could take the place of strength, in
the real battle of life. She was a brave
girl, and she felt sure in her heart that
the man of the most courage must be the
best man after all.
</p>

<p>
For awhile she appeared to persuade
herself that it was Prosper, beyond a
doubt, and always took his part when the
other girls laughed at him. But this was
not altogether a good sign. When a girl
really loves, she does not talk, she acts.
The current of opinion and gossip in the
village was too strong for her. By the
time of the affair of the "chopping-down"
at <i>Lac des Caps</i>, her heart was swinging
to and fro like a pendulum. One week
she would walk home from mass with
Raoul. The next week she would loiter
in the front yard on a Saturday evening
and talk over the gate with Prosper, until
her father called her into the shop to wait
on customers.
</p>

<p>
It was in one of these talks that the
pendulum seemed to make its last swing
and settle down to its resting-place. Prosper
was telling her of the good crop of
sugar that he had just made from his
maple grove.
</p>

<p>
"The profit will be large&mdash;more than
forty piastres&mdash;and with that I shall buy
at Chicoutimi a new <i>quatre-roue</i>, of the
finest, a veritable wedding-carriage&mdash;if
you&mdash;if I&mdash;'Toinette? Shall we ride together?"
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-031b.jpg" width="349" height="96" alt="Street View" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
</p>

<p>
His left hand clasped hers as it lay on
the gate. His right arm stole over the
low picket fence and went around the
shoulder that leaned against the gate-post.
The road was quite empty, the night already
dark. He could feel her warm
breath on his neck as she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"If you! If I! If what? Why so
many ifs in this fine speech? Of whom
is the wedding for which this new carriage
is to be bought? Do you know what
Raoul Vaillantcœur has said? 'No more
wedding in this parish till I have thrown
the little Prosper over my shoulder!'"
</p>

<p>
As she said this, laughing, she turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
closer to the fence and looked up, so that
a curl on her forehead brushed against his
cheek.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="422" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">He gripped Prosper by the head.&mdash;<a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
"<i>Baptême!</i> Who told you he said
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard him, myself."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In the store, two nights ago. But it
was not for the first time. He said it
when we came from the church together,
it will be four weeks to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"What did you say to him?"
</p>

<p>
"I told him perhaps he was mistaken.
The next wedding might be after the little
Prosper had measured the road with
the back of the longest man in Abbéville."
</p>

<p>
The laugh had gone out of her voice
now. She was speaking eagerly, and her
bosom rose and fell with quick breaths.
But Prosper's right arm had dropped from
her shoulder, and his hand gripped the
fence as he straightened up.
</p>

<p>
"'Toinette!" he cried, "that was
bravely said. And I could do it. Yes, I
know I could do it. But, <i>mon Dieu</i>, what
shall I say? Three years now, he has
pushed me, everyone has pushed me, to
fight. And you&mdash;but I cannot. I am
not capable of that."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-035.jpg" width="424" height="550" alt="" />
</div>
<p>
The girl's hand lay in his
as cold and still as a stone.
She was silent for a moment,
and then asked, coldly, "Why
not, Monsieur Leclère?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not? Because of
the old friendship. Because
he pulled me out of the river
long ago. Because I am
still his friend. Because now
he hates me too much. Because
it would be a black
fight. Because shame and
evil would come of it, whoever
won. That is what I
am afraid of, 'Toinette!"
</p>

<p>
Her hand slipped suddenly
away from his. She
stepped back from the gate.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tiens!</i> You have fear,
Monsieur Leclère! Truly?
I had not thought of that.
It is strange. For so strong
a man it is a little stupid. Good-night. I
hear my father calling me. Perhaps some
one in the store who wants to be served.
You must tell me again what you are going
to do with the new <i>quatre-roue</i>. Good-night!"
</p>

<p>
She was laughing again. But it was a
different laughter. Prosper, at the gate,
did not think it sounded like the running
of a brook over the stones. No, it was
more the noise of the dry branches that
knock together in the wind. He did not
hear the sigh that came as she shut the
door of the house, nor see how slowly she
walked through the passage into the store.
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
There seemed to be a great many rainy
Saturdays that spring; and in the early
summer the trade in Girard's store was
so brisk that it appeared to need all the
force of the establishment to attend to it.
The gate of the front yard had no more
strain put upon its hinges. It fell into a
stiff propriety of opening and shutting at
the touch of people who understood that
a gate was made merely to pass through,
not to lean upon.
</p>

<p>
That summer Vaillantcœur had a new
hat&mdash;<i>chapeau de castor</i>&mdash;black and shiny&mdash;and
a new red-silk cravat. They looked
fine on Corpus Christi day, when he and
'Toinette walked in the procession as <i>fiancées</i>.
</p>

<p>
You would have thought he would have
been content with that. Proud, he certainly
was. He stepped like the <i>curé's</i>
big rooster with the top-knot&mdash;almost as
far up in the air as he did along the
ground; and he held his chin high, as if
he liked to look at things over his nose.
</p>

<p>
But he was not satisfied all the way
through. He thought more of beating
Prosper than of getting 'Toinette. <i>And
he was not quite sure that he had beaten
him yet.</i> Perhaps the girl still liked Prosper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
a little. Perhaps she still thought of his
romances, and his <i>chansons</i>, and his fine,
smooth words, and missed them. Perhaps
she was too silent and dull sometimes,
when she walked with Raoul; and sometimes
she laughed too loud when he talked,
more at him than with him. Perhaps
those St. Raymond fellows still remembered
the way his head stuck out of that
cursed snow-drift, and joked about it, and
said how clever and quick the little Prosper
was. Perhaps&mdash;ah, <i>dame!</i> a thousand
times perhaps! And only one way to settle
them, the old way, the sure way, and all
the better now because 'Toinette must be
on his side. She must understand for sure
that the best man in the parish had chosen
her.
</p>

<p>
That was the summer of the building of
the grand stone tower of the church. The
men of Abbéville did it themselves, with
their own hands, for the glory of God.
They were keen about that, and the <i>curé</i>
was the keenest of them all. No sharing
of that glory with workmen from Quebec,
if you please! Abbéville was only forty
years old, but they already understood the
glory of God quite as well there as at
Quebec, without doubt. They could build
their own tower, perfectly, and they would.
Besides, it would cost less.
</p>

<p>
Vaillantcœur was the chief carpenter.
He attended to the affair of beams and timbers.
Leclère was the chief mason. He
directed the affair of dressing the stones
and laying them. That required a very
careful head, you understand, for the tower
must be straight. In the floor a little
crookedness did not matter; but in the
wall&mdash;that might be serious. People have
been killed by a falling tower. Of course,
if they were going into church, they would
be sure of heaven. But then think&mdash;what
a disgrace for Abbéville!
</p>

<p>
Everyone was glad that Leclère bossed
the raising of the tower. They admitted
that he might be <i>lâche</i>, but he was assuredly
careful. Vaillantcœur alone grumbled,
and said the work went too slowly, and
even swore that the sockets for the beams
were too shallow, or else too deep, it made
no difference which. That <i>bête</i> Prosper
made trouble always by his poor work.
But the friction never came to a blaze;
for the <i>curé</i> was pottering about the tower
every day and all day long, and a few
words from him would make a quarrel go
off in smoke.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Doucement, mes garçons</i>," he would
say; "work smooth and you work fast.
The logs in the river run well when they
run all the same way. But when two logs
cross each other, on the same rock&mdash;psst!
a jam! The whole drive is hung up! Do
not run crossways, my children."
</p>

<p>
The walls rose steadily, straight as a
steamboat pipe&mdash;ten, twenty, thirty, forty
feet; it was time to put in the two cross-girders,
lay the floor of the belfry, finish
off the stonework, and begin the pointed
wooden spire. The <i>curé</i> had gone to
Quebec that very day to buy the shining
plates of tin for the roof, and a beautiful
cross of gilt for the pinnacle.
</p>

<p>
Leclère was in front of the tower putting
on his overalls. Vaillantcœur came up,
swearing mad. Three or four other workmen
were standing about.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you Leclère," said he, "I
tried one of the cross-girders yesterday
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
afternoon and it wouldn't go. The templet
on the north is crooked&mdash;crooked as
your teeth. We had to let the girder
down again. I suppose we must trim it
off some way, to get a level bearing, and
make the tower weak, just to match your
<i>sacré</i> bad work, eh?"
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-036.jpg" width="514" height="224" alt="Body on the Ground" />
</div>

<p>
"Well," said Prosper, pleasant and quiet
enough, "I'm sorry for that, Raoul. Perhaps
I could put that templet straight,
or perhaps the girder might be a little
warped and twisted, eh? What? Suppose
we measure it."
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, they found the long timber
was not half seasoned and had cork-screwed
itself out of shape at least three
inches. Vaillantcœur sat on the sill of
the doorway and did not even look at
them while they were measuring. When
they called out to him what they had
found, he strode over to them.
</p>

<p>
"It's a dam' lie," he said, sullenly.
"Prosper Leclère, you slipped the string.
None of your <i>sacré chicane</i>! I have
enough of it already. Will you fight, you
cursed sneak?"
</p>

<p>
Prosper's face went gray, like the mortar
in the trough. His fists clenched and
the cords on his neck stood out as if they
were ropes. He breathed hard. But he
only said three words:
</p>

<p>
"No! Not here."
</p>

<p>
"Not here? Why not? There is room.
The <i>curé</i> is away. Why not here?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the house of <i>le bon Dieu</i>. Can
we build it in hate?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Polisson!</i> You make an excuse.
Then come to Girard's, and fight there."
</p>

<p>
Again Prosper held in for a moment,
and spoke three words:
</p>

<p>
"No! Not now."
</p>

<p>
"Not now? But when, you heart of
a hare? Will you sneak out of it until
you turn gray and die? When will you
fight, little musk-rat?"
</p>

<p>
"When I have forgotten. When I am
no more your friend."
</p>

<p>
Prosper picked up his trowel and went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
into the tower. Raoul bad-worded him
and every stone of his building from foundation
to cornice, and then went down
the road to get a bottle of cognac.
</p>

<p>
An hour later he came back breathing
out threatenings and slaughter, strongly
flavored with raw spirits. Prosper was
working quietly on the top of the tower,
at the side away from the road. He saw
nothing until Raoul, climbing up by the
ladders on the inside, leaped on the platform
and rushed at him like a crazy lynx.
</p>

<p>
"Now!" he cried, "no hole to hide in
here, rat! I'll squeeze the lies out of you."
</p>

<p>
He gripped Prosper by the head, thrusting
one thumb into his eye, and pushing
him backward on the scaffolding.
</p>

<p>
Blinded, half-maddened by the pain,
Prosper thought of nothing but to get free.
He swung his long arm upward and landed
a fearful blow on Raoul's face that dislocated
the jaw; then twisting himself downward
and sideways, he fell in toward the
wall. Raoul plunged forward, stumbled,
let go his hold, and pitched out from the
tower, arms spread, clutching the air.
</p>

<p>
Forty feet straight down! A moment&mdash;or
was it an eternity?&mdash;of horrible silence.
Then the body struck the rough
stones at the foot of the tower with a thick,
soft dunt, and lay crumpled up among
them, without a groan, without a movement.
</p>

<p>
When the other men, who had hurried
up the ladders in terror, found Leclère, he
was peering over the edge of the scaffold,
wiping the blood from his eyes, trying to
see down.
</p>

<p>
"I have killed him," he muttered, "my
friend! He is smashed to death. I am
a murderer. Let me go. I must throw
myself down!"
</p>

<p>
They had hard work to hold him back.
As they forced him down the ladders he
trembled like a poplar.
</p>

<p>
But Vaillantcœur was not dead. No;
it was incredible&mdash;to fall forty feet and
not be killed&mdash;they talk of it yet all through
the valley of the Lake St. John&mdash;it was a
miracle! But Vaillantcœur had broken
only a nose, a collar-bone, and three ribs&mdash;for
one like him that was but a <i>bagatelle</i>.
A good doctor from Chicoutimi, a few
months of nursing, and he would be on
his feet again, almost as good a man as
he had ever been.
</p>

<p>
It was Leclère who put himself in
charge of this.
</p>

<p>
"It is my affair," he said&mdash;"my fault!
It was not a fair place to fight. Why did
I strike? I must attend to this bad
work."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mais, sacré bleu!</i>" they answered,
"how could you help it? He forced you.
You did not want to be killed. That
would be a little too much."
</p>

<p>
"No," he persisted, "this is my affair.
Girard, you know my money is with the
<i>notaire</i>. There is plenty. Raoul has not
enough, perhaps not any. But he shall
want nothing&mdash;you understand&mdash;nothing!
It is my affair, all that he needs&mdash;but you
shall not tell him&mdash;no! That is all. <i>C'est
fini!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Prosper had his way. But he did not
see Vaillantcœur after he was carried
home and put to bed in his cabin. Even
if he had tried to do it, it would have been
impossible. He could not see anybody.
One of his eyes was entirely destroyed.
The inflammation spread to the other, and
all through the autumn he lay in his house,
drifting along the edge of blindness, while
Raoul lay in his house slowly getting well.
</p>

<p>
The <i>curé</i> went from one house to the
other, but he did not carry any messages
between them. If any were sent one way
they were not received. And the other
way, none were sent. Raoul did not
speak of Prosper; and if one mentioned
his name, Raoul shut his mouth and made
no answer.
</p>

<p>
To the <i>curé</i>, of course, it was a distress
and a misery. To have a hatred like this
unhealed, was a blot on the parish; it was
a shame, as well as a sin. At last&mdash;it was
already winter, the day before Christmas&mdash;the
<i>curé</i> made up his mind that he would
put forth one more great effort.
</p>

<p>
"Look you, my son," he said to Prosper,
"I am going this afternoon to Raoul
Vaillantcœur to make the reconciliation.
You shall give me a word to carry to him.
He shall hear it this time, I promise you.
Shall I tell him what you have done for
him, how you have cared for him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never," said Prosper, "you shall
not take that word from me. It is nothing.
It will make worse trouble. I will
never send it."
</p>

<p>
"What then?" said the priest. "Shall
I tell him that you forgive him?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No, not that," answered Prosper,
"that would be a foolish word. What
would that mean? It is not I who can
forgive. I was the one who struck hardest.
It was he that fell from the tower."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, choose the word for yourself.
What shall it be? Come, I promise
you that he shall hear it. I will take with
me <i>M. le Notaire</i>, and the good man
Girard, and the little Marie Antoinette.
You shall hear an answer. What message?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon père</i>," said Prosper, slowly, "you
shall tell him just this. I, Prosper Leclère,
ask Raoul Vaillantcœur that he will forgive
me for not fighting with him on the
ground when he demanded it."
</p>

<p>
Yes, the message was given in precisely
those words. Marie Antoinette stood
within the door, Bergeron and Girard at
the foot of the bed, and the <i>curé</i> spoke
very clearly and firmly. Vaillantcœur
rolled on his pillow and turned his face
away. Then he sat up in bed, grunting
a little with the pain in his shoulder, which
was badly set. His black eyes snapped
like the eyes of a wolverine in a corner.
</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-037.jpg" width="444" height="430" alt="He Sat up in Bed" />
</div>

<p>
"Forgive?" he said, "no, never. He
is a coward. I will never forgive!"
</p>

<p>
A little later in the afternoon, when the
rose of sunset lay on the snowy hills, some
one knocked at the door of Leclère's
house.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Entrez!</i>" he cried. "Who is there? I
see not very well by this light. Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is me," said 'Toinette, her cheeks
rosier than the snow outside, "nobody but
me. I have come to ask you about that
new carriage&mdash;do you remember?"
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
The voice in the canoe behind me
ceased. The rain let up. The <i>slish</i>, <i>slish</i>
of the paddle stopped. The canoe swung
sideways to the breeze. I heard the rap,
rap, rap of a pipe on the gunwale, and the
scratch of a match on the under side of
the thwart.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing, Ferdinand?"
</p>

<p>
"I go to light the pipe, M'sieu'."
</p>

<p>
"Is the story finished?"
</p>

<p>
"But yes&mdash;but no&mdash;I know not, M'sieu'.
As you will."
</p>

<p>
"But what did old Girard say when
his daughter broke her engagement and
married a man whose eyes were spoiled?"
</p>

<p>
"He said that Leclère could see well
enough to work with him in the store."
</p>

<p>
"And what did Vaillantcœur say when
he lost his girl?"
</p>

<p>
"He said it was a cursed shame that
one could not fight a blind man."
</p>

<p>
"And what did 'Toinette say?"
</p>

<p>
"She said she had chosen the bravest
man in Abbéville."
</p>

<p>
"And Prosper&mdash;what did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"M'sieu', I know not. He spoke only
to 'Toinette."

<p class="drop-cap">
Beatrice was making an
angel. She had lifted down
the Princess Angelica from
the hook whence her royal
highness had been suspended
since her death a
few weeks before, had removed the royal
crown and the royal legs, and was turning
the royal robe into celestial drapery. Beatrice's
conception of a heavenly garment
was a white morning wrapper gathered at
the bottom, so that when the angel soared
head downward&mdash;as angels do&mdash;its clothes
could not fall over its face. Beside Beatrice,
who was seated on the floor, lay a
pair of wings constructed of muslin tacked
upon thin sticks; and about her feet
writhed long wires designed to support
the angel that evening in its visitation to
her father's Italian marionette theatre.
</p>

<p>
It was behind the scenes that I was
waiting for her father to come in; and
meanwhile I lounged upon the helpers'
bench and enjoyed the quaintness of the
place.
</p>

<p>
Lighted by an irresolute gas-jet, the
space between the back-drop and the rear
wall of the theatre was a chaos of strange
objects. Beside me, upon the bench, lay
the book of the play&mdash;a collection of those
legends of Charlemagne's court, descended
from the <i>Chansons de gestes</i>, which have
been so dear to Italian poets and are still
so dear to the Italian people. Each afternoon
the manager read over the adventure
to be presented in the evening. When
the curtain rose he took his stand in the
wings and declaimed lines extemporized
to fit the situations. The helpers, from
their places upon the high bench, leaned
over the back-drop, swung the marionettes
upon the stage by means of long rods
running down through the heads of the
figures, and by means of other rods and
of strings caused the mock men and
women to make gestures and to fight.
That was a task which told upon heads as
well as hands; for the helpers were bound,
not only to make the figures walk&mdash;no
light labor, for each puppet weighed seventy
pounds&mdash;but also to make them express
the sentiment of every speech as it
fell from Pietro's lips. Many times had I
tried to handle a marionette and as often
had failed; and I looked with respect
upon the row of little creatures hung about
the walls from a rack. They were dight
in the panoply of knighthood. At my
left shone the brass armor of the Christianos.
The right was brilliant with the
party-colored robes and turbans and the
glowering faces of dusky infidels. The
corners were piled high with heterogeneous
properties; bright silks, bits of armor,
shields, swords. From the right-hand
heap protruded a ghastly leg, lopped from
a Christian. The summit of the opposite
heap was the grinning head of a dragon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
which had met death a few nights before
in terrible battle with Orlando.
</p>

<p>
The dragon's body was a comfortable
support for Beatrice's back. Of her face,
bent over her work, I could see only an
obstinate little olive-colored chin, two
faintly red cheeks, and two straight black
brows. Her hair hung over ears and
shoulders and fell in dusky tangles upon a
green silk waist. Ordinarily, Italian girls
begin early in life to use hairpins.
</p>

<p>
"How old are you, Beatrice?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked up and opened wide a
pair of great tawny eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How old, Signore?" she repeated, in
her low, husky voice. "Fifteen-a. Nex'
moont' I s'all be sixteen-a."
</p>

<p>
"So old!" I commented. "Almost a
woman. You'll be having a sweetheart
soon; and what will your father do when
he wants an angel?"
</p>

<p>
Again I saw of Beatrice only a veil of
hair and a hand rapidly plying to and fro.
</p>

<p>
"No, Signore," she murmured from
behind her screen. "I am not enough
old-a. I s'all nevair marry. Who would
tak-a me?"
</p>

<p>
"Anselmo?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
I caught a gleam of the tawny eyes
through the hair.
</p>

<p>
"I do not tink of 'im!" she expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"The other helper, then. What's his
name? Giuseppe?"
</p>

<p>
Beatrice ceased to sew, tossed her hair
away from her face, and shook her head
slowly. The pink in her cheeks had deepened,
but her luminous eyes gazed straight
into mine.
</p>

<p>
"Signore," she said, impressively, "I
ask-a to credit me. I do not tink of
eit'er of desa men."
</p>

<p>
I found myself abashed, as if I had
been making light of sacred things.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Beatrice," I stammered.
"It's not my business, of course.
I'm sorry I spoke of it."
</p>

<p>
Without making reply she bent over
her work again. For some moments she
sewed, while I chid myself for suggesting
romance to a sensible child.
</p>

<p>
Rapid steps beat upon the stairs outside,
and Beatrice's father hurried into
the little den.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice," he called, sharply, in his
own language, "go thou to the ticket-office.
It is the hour of admittance for
the people. I will finish the angel."
</p>

<p>
The girl dropped her needle and sped
out through the door. The manager
slammed it behind her, turned toward me,
drew up his shoulders, and raised his eyes
toward heaven.
</p>

<p>
"May the saints aid me to make righteous
that child!" he exclaimed. "Both
of my helpers came to me to-day to ask
her in marriage. She promised herself
to both last night."
</p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
It so happened that a year elapsed before
I visited the theatre again. During
that time I had fallen in love with the
most charming girl in the world. In my
college days I had patronized her young-maiden
adoration; but when she came
home, after three years of travel, the most
self-possessed, as well as the most beautiful
of women, the adoration and the
indifference exchanged places. All I
seemed to win from her was good-comradeship
and confidence; and they were
due to the friend of her childhood.
</p>

<p>
She had travelled with her mother,
whose delight was picture-galleries, court-balls,
and dinners at embassies. Of
unconventional life, Deborah had seen
nothing, and she listened eagerly to my
descriptions of nooks and corners in New
York.
</p>

<p>
One day her mother yielded. Deborah
might go through the foreign quarter with
me, if I would promise not to bring her
into danger from men or germs.
</p>

<p>
For our first expedition I chose the
Italian theatre. It was safe, picturesque,
unique. We drove to the door in a hansom,
and I instructed the driver to call
for us at eleven o'clock.
</p>

<p>
As we entered the tiny foyer my companion
murmured a little "Ah!" of delight.
The walls had been decorated by
the manager himself with wonderful pictures
of kings, queens, knights, and ladies.
The colors were green, red, and white,
because those were the paints Pietro had
on hand. Upon one side Orlando and
Olliviero were fighting their famous duel
in the presence of Charlemagne and his
gorgeous court. Pietro's admiration was
for legs. Those of Orlando had muscles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
unknown to anatomists, and those of his
cousin were big enough for two Ollivieros.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="456" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Beatrice was making an angel.</p>
</div>

<p>
While Deborah was trembling with
pleasure in this work of art, I heard the
latch of the ticket-office door click, and,
turning, saw Beatrice. She stood upon
the threshold, gazing not at me but at Deborah.
In a year she had grown tall.
Her hair was coiled upon her neck, and
her eyes seemed to be deeper and tawnier
than ever.
</p>

<p>
"What a pretty child!" exclaimed my
companion.
</p>

<p>
"It's Beatrice," I answered. "How
do you do, little girl? How is Pietro?"
</p>

<p>
"My father is well," replied the girl;
but her scrutiny still rested upon my companion's
face and yellow hair. Under
this inspection Deborah was flushing, and
I hastened to end it.
</p>

<p>
"This is Miss Speedwell, Beatrice." I
said. "She has come with me to see the
play. You must give us good seats."
</p>

<p>
Beatrice touched Deborah's glove with
a soiled paw, and, without a word of reply,
led the way through the door of the theatre
and along the aisle.
</p>

<p>
We had arrived early, and the theatre
was empty. The place was fascinating
enough, but I noticed that my companion,
who was commonly both curious and self-reliant,
followed me closely.
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful, strange child," she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"H&mdash;m! child!" I said to myself, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
fell to musing upon
my last visit to the
theatre.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-043a.jpg" width="193" height="324" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"She promised herself to both last night."</p>
</div>

<p>
"Beatrice," I
asked, "are you
married yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Signore,"
answered
the girl, without
turning her head.
</p>

<p>
"What has become
of Anselmo?"
I went on.
</p>

<p>
"He is 'ere. 'E
is our helper."
</p>

<p>
"And Giuseppe?"
</p>

<p>
"'E is 'ere. My
father cood not-a get
better helpers. Why
dey go away?"
</p>

<p>
This I could not
answer. Beatrice
had a way of making
me shamefaced.
</p>

<p>
"Dese are your
seats," she said, pausing at the third row
of settees. "Now I begga to pardon, I
must go to my father."
</p>

<p>
"But you'll come back, won't you, Beatrice?"
I asked. "We have forgotten
some of our Italian, and we need you to
interpret for us&mdash;just as you used to interpret
for me."
</p>

<p>
This attempt to establish old-time relations
fell flat. Beatrice replied, "Yes,
Signore," in calm tones, and left us. When
she had closed the door, Deborah drew a
long breath.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-043b.jpg" width="252" height="329" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Had once been a stable.</p>
</div>

<p>
"I'm glad she's gone," said Deborah.
"She made me feel uncanny."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," I laughed. "She's only
a queer little girl. Look at Pietro's paintings;
they are more wholesome."
</p>

<p>
The dingy little theatre had once been
a stable. Pietro had turned the loft into
a gallery, with tiers of benches receding
high into the gloom. He had cut off the
stall-room with a wooden proscenium.
Upon it twined a mastodon of a vine, the
like of which no botanist ever beheld.
The toy curtain bore, upon its forty-eight
square feet of canvas, a representation of
a Roman triumph that would have insured
Pietro's admission into any Academy with
a sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
It cheered Deborah amazingly, and the
audience, which burst in at eight o'clock,
caused her to clasp her hands. It was
chiefly composed of men&mdash;laborers, chestnut
venders, and bootblacks, with swarthy
skins, gleaming eyes, and gleaming teeth.
They rushed, shouting, down the single
aisle, sprang over settees, scrambled and
pushed to win the seats nearest the stage.
In three minutes the theatre was a bewilderment
of bobbing heads and active
hands, and a tumult of voices and laughter.
Not a seat was vacant except those upon
our settee. The Italians had respected
the presence of strangers. The men in
front of us and on either hand turned
about to greet the American lady and to
smile a welcome.
</p>

<p>
Deborah returned every smile and every
bow. Her eyes were bright with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"How nice they are! How polite!"
she exclaimed. Presently she laid a clinging
hand upon my arm.
</p>

<p>
"How can I ever thank you," she
whispered, "for bringing me here!"
</p>

<p>
I tried to tell her by a look, but her attention
was not for me.
</p>

<p>
"See," she went on, "see the faun!"
</p>

<p>
A slender boy appeared in the proscenium
doorway. His hair clustered
about deep red cheeks, and his great dark
eyes looked mournfully over the house. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
fancied he was seeking someone. The
audience hailed him with applause and he
descended two or three steps to the street-piano,
which served as orchestra, and began
to turn the crank. Deborah started,
raised eyebrows of dismay, and pressed her
hands over her ears. Never before had
she heard the Intermezzo from Cavalleria
rendered by a street-piano in a twenty by
forty foot room.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-044.jpg" width="517" height="423" alt="" />
<p class="caption">She wheeled about and stamped her foot. "Silence, pigs!" she screamed.</p>
</div>

<p>
Beatrice, appearing at my side, evidently
perceived the gesture. Her face
turned crimson and she drew herself up
proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Gaiterno!" she called, "stop that
noise."
</p>

<p>
The boy paused, and, still bent over at
the lower curve of his stroke, turned an
astonished face toward us. The chatter
from the seats hushed.
</p>

<p>
"Stop the music," repeated Beatrice,
imperiously.
</p>

<p>
A grumble sounded in the rear and increased
from seat to seat until it was a
growl. The corners of Beatrice's mouth
curled up like those of an angry cat. She
wheeled about and stamped her foot.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, pigs!" she screamed.
</p>

<p>
The tumult fell away. For a moment
the girl stood poised as if ready to spring,
and then turned, and, in the hush passed
beyond us to a seat at Deborah's farther
side. My companion shrank slightly toward
me and once more laid a hand upon
my arm. Her face was turned toward
Beatrice, whose color had died down and
whose eyes were perfectly indifferent.
</p>

<p>
The raising of the curtain put an end
to the strain. The audience, forgetting
their disappointment, bent excited faces
toward the stage, and so, after a few
moments, did Deborah.
</p>

<p>
I fear I was an inattentive spectator. I
dared not move lest I should disturb that
precious touch upon my arm, and the eager
face before me I found a sight more fascinating
than the absurd gestures of puppets.
But presently, beyond Deborah's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
face appeared Beatrice's, and a certain self-consciousness
in its expression took my
notice. The girl's lips were pressed together
and her eyes were directed sternly
toward the stage, but it was evidently with
an effort that she
held them thus. A
glance about the
theatre gave me the
clew. The faun by
the street-piano was
looking full at her,
with such a face of
adoration as I had
read of but never
beheld. It was
pathetic, but it was
funny as well, and
I laughed. Glances
of scorn from Deborah
and Beatrice
punished me, and
Deborah transferred
the hand to her lap.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">With such a face of adoration as I had read of.</p>
</div>

<p>
"Do you understand
what is going
on?" I whispered.
"The scene is in the
court of the Soldan
of Africa. That
trembling creature
is an envoy from
Carlo Magno, come
to demand the Soldan's
surrender.
The play, you know,
is six months long.
Each adventure
takes up one night."
</p>

<p>
Here Deborah
pointed a monitory
finger toward the
stage, and I
shrugged my shoulders
in silence.
</p>

<p>
Indeed the drama
had reached a crisis. The Soldan had
committed the envoy to a dungeon. While
the prisoner grovelled upon the floor, in
stalked the Soldan with the haughty stride,
achieved by marionettes only. In his
hand he bore a sword.
</p>

<p>
"The hour of thy choice is come," announced
the infidel. "Renounce thy faith.
Acknowledge the true God and Mahomet
his prophet and thou goest free. If thou
refuse, this shall be thy last moment on
earth."
</p>

<p>
Many visits to the theatre had prepared
me for the sound of indrawn breaths on
every side. Deborah glanced curiously
around her, but instantly
turned again
to the scene. The
Christian had struggled
to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" he
said in feeble tones.
"I can die, but I
cannot be false to
my faith."
</p>

<p>
The Pagan raised
his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Dog of a Christian,
die!" he
roared, and cut the
captive down.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Infame! infame!</i>"
screamed
the audience. Settees
scraped, shoes
pounded, and men
sprang to their feet.
About us was a
hurly-burly of brandished
fists, glaring
eyes, snarling lips,
flashing teeth. Apples,
bananas, split
peas, and I thought
a knife or two, hurtled
toward the
stage. Deborah uttered
a little scream
and started up.
</p>

<p>
The curtain, falling
swiftly, shut off
the craven monarch
from this just indignation,
and instantly
the raging mob
turned into an assemblage
of light-hearted citizens, laughing,
chaffing, tossing up their heads to
drink beer out of bottles or oval tin pails.
</p>

<p>
Deborah understood, and a smile curved
her lips, but her eyes were wide and deep
with recent fright.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it amazing?" I ventured.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="550" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>Infame! Infame!</i>" screamed the audience.</p>
</div>

<p>
"Yes!" she agreed, faintly. "It's&mdash;it's
Elizabethan. I wish we Americans
could take our theatre as seriously. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
don't wonder, though, that they were excited.
I was a little under the spell myself.
I could easily fancy that those dolls
were alive."
</p>

<p>
"Look at Beatrice," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
The girl had not yet recovered her composure.
Her hands were clinched and her
breath came deep and fast. Deborah
eyed her sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"It seems very real, doesn't it, my
dear?" said Deborah.
</p>

<p>
Beatrice turned upon her.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i>-a r-real!" she exclaimed. "It
was-a te-r-<i>rue</i>! 'E did kill-a da Christiano.
It was long ago. You are-a cold,
you Americani!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Beatrice," I interposed.
"You must not speak like that to Miss
Speedwell. Take us to your father at
once. I shall tell him that you are a
naughty girl."
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
In the little enclosure behind the scenes
Pietro gave us a welcome that raised a
lump in my throat.
</p>

<p>
"Old friend!" he exclaimed, in his
pure Tuscan.
"Why have you
left us lonely so
long? The theatre
has not been a
satisfaction without
you. No one
understands it as
you do."
</p>

<p>
As I shook his
hand I noted that
his dark eyes had
dulled over, and
that anxiety had
cut a wrinkle between
his white
old brows.
</p>

<p>
"I am making
amends," I answered.
"I am
bringing someone
who will comprehend
your art as
well as I."
</p>

<p>
"This lady!
You are married,
then. It is well."
</p>

<p>
Deborah turned
away, and though I hastened to explain,
I felt a thrill of joy. She was not carrying
off an embarrassing situation with her
wonted lightness.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, only an old friend," I said.
"I am not married. Deborah, let me
introduce Pietro. He is a true artist. He
might be making himself rich by taking
his daughter and a street-piano to the restaurants,
but he prefers to stick to his
art and to live on a little."
</p>

<p>
Pietro's face fell.
</p>

<p>
"It is not altogether that," he said.
"It is true that I love the drama. But
also I do not find that it is good for Beatrice
to go where there are people who
look on."
</p>

<p>
I looked a question at him.
</p>

<p>
"Would not the lady like to handle a
marionette?" replied the manager. "It
is the beginning of knowledge about our
drama. Anselmo, show the lady how to
manage the figures."
</p>

<p>
As Anselmo led Deborah away, a change
in the room, of which I had been dimly
aware, insisted upon my full attention. A
high wooden partition divided the helpers'
bench into two parts.
</p>

<p>
"What is that for, Pietro?"
I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The old man drew a heavy
sigh.
</p>

<p>
"It is Beatrice," he explained.
"She has bewitched
my two helpers. They cannot
meet without blows. So I have
arranged that each remains
upon his own side of the room.
Anselmo handles
the Christians;
Giuseppe the
Moslems. I have
made high the
boards, so that
they cannot meet
upon the bench."
</p>

<p>
"So-o-o," I
whistled. I ran
over in my mind
Pietro's anxious
face, Beatrice's
cool reply to my
question about the
helpers, and the
pleading gaze of
the faun.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="278" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"My two helpers, with the shields and the swords of Orlando
and Rinaldo, fought!"</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Who is the boy at the piano?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Gaiterno? He is her cousin. He
worships her. It would be a good match,
but she will not listen to him. He is not
strong enough, she
says."
</p>

<p>
"The little coquette!"
I commented.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Signore, it is
not that!" sighed
Pietro. "It is the
play. The play is in
her head. Life to her
is the play. She holds
herself to be a princess.
Strong men love
her, she thinks. She
says she will smile
upon no one who is
not as strong as Rinaldo.
Listen, Signore.
This is what I
saw when I made entrance
here three days
ago. My two helpers,
with the shields
and the swords of Orlando
and Rinaldo,
fought, while Beatrice,
with the crown
of Angelica upon her
head, sat upon the
throne of Carlo Magno,
and urged them
on."
</p>

<p>
The old man's
arms were flourishing,
and his eyes were
bright.
</p>

<p>
"I made Anselmo
to go away upon the instant," he went on;
"but Beatrice, she made a threat that she
would elope with him. What could I do?
I am an old man. She is my only child.
You see&mdash;he is still here."
</p>

<p>
The fire in his eyes went out, his head
sank upon his breast, and his hands fell to
his sides. I grasped one of them in mine.
</p>

<p>
The old man returned my grasp bravely,
and tried to smile.
</p>

<p>
"It is sad, is it not, my friend," he said,
"that my art should have brought this
misfortune upon me!"
</p>

<p>
Deborah's laughter gurgled down from
the bench. Evidently she was in difficulties
with her marionettes. An idea came
to me.
</p>

<p>
"Wait for me one minute," I said.
"Perhaps Miss Speedwell can help us."
</p>

<p>
"It is time to raise
the curtain," answered
Pietro. "You
are a good friend. I
go to my work with
an uplifted heart."
</p>

<p>
I hastened to the
steps at the end of
the bench. As I
turned to mount
them, I felt a hand
upon mine, and found
Beatrice beside me.
</p>

<p>
"You lofe-a her!"
declared the child,
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
The thought that
I carried my heart
upon my sleeve annoyed
me.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice," I exclaimed,
"you must
learn not to be silly.
You are too young to
think of such things."
</p>

<p>
"You not-a say
dat once," returned
Beatrice, reproachfully;
and the recollection
of my indiscreet
chaffing added
to my annoyance. I
hurried away, doubtful
of my plan. But
my kind-hearted
companion received
it eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Ask her to visit us in the country?
Of course I will!" she exclaimed, when
I had told the story.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-048.jpg" width="241" height="492" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Her arms were folded across her breast.</p>
</div>

<p>
During the next act we sat upon one of
the heaps of properties, still piled in the
corners, and arranged Beatrice's future.
We constituted ourselves god and goddess
<i>ex machinâ</i> to make a noble woman of the
little girl. She was to spend a whole summer
face to face with nature, at Deborah's
father's pet stock-farm. There she would
forget plays and learn to milk cows and to
cook. Perhaps, at the end of the season,
Gaiterno might be asked to visit her. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
wooing of the faun and the maiden amid
Colonel Speedwell's groves appealed to
Deborah's sense of the picturesque. What
appealed to me was the provision in the
plan that I should run down every Sunday
to watch the progress of education.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-049.jpg" width="550" height="351" alt="" />
<p class="caption">It struck Anselmo fairly in the chest and laid him low.</p>
</div>

<p>
Plotting was a very pleasant occupation,
and we both started at the thunder
of applause and the trampling of feet
outside. The play was over&mdash;the audience
was going home. I rose to my feet
reluctantly, and I hoped that I detected
in Deborah's deliberation a willingness to
linger. While she was watching the helpers,
as they hung Orlando and his comrades
upon the rack, Pietro came to bid
us good-night. Beatrice followed him as
far as the doorway. I did not think it
best that her good fortune should be revealed
to her as yet, and while Deborah
was laying it before her father, I asked
the child to see if my cab was ready. She
drew herself up resentfully, but sulked
away. After a long time she returned
with word that no cab was in sight.
</p>

<p>
"No cab?" I asked, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
I stumbled through the door, and down
half a dozen steps and ran along the passage
that led to the street. Beatrice had
told the truth. No cab was in sight. Indeed
the street was vacant. A March
rain had begun to fall, driving everyone
indoors and making a mirror of the pavement.
It flashed to me the lights of an
electric car crossing the street half a dozen
blocks away.
</p>

<p>
"She'd get fearfully wet," I mused, "and
her mother would put a stopper on trips."
</p>

<p>
While I was searching my brains for an
expedient, Pietro came running down the
hallway.
</p>

<p>
"Have no care, my good friend," he
panted. "Beatrice has told me of cabs
at the ferry. It is but a dozen squares.
I go to order a cab. Go you to your kind
lady."
</p>

<p>
Greatly relieved, I returned behind the
scenes. In the hall I passed Anselmo,
and wondered why Beatrice had not sent
him instead of her father forth into the
wet; but I reflected that perhaps relations
between the girl and her lovers might be
strained. Thanks for her thoughtfulness
were on my lips as I opened the door.
They were never spoken, however. Beatrice
stood by the partition, alone. Her
hair, loosed from its knot, hung wild about
her shoulders. Her arms were folded
across her breast. One foot was planted
forward, and I saw under it Deborah's
fur cape.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice!" I exclaimed. "What on
earth is the matter with you? Where is
Miss Speedwell?"
</p>

<p>
The girl stretched forth both arms toward
me.
</p>

<p>
"You list-a me," she said. "You tink
she lof-a you. It is not. It is I! I
lof-a you. I 'ave lof-a you one year.
You come one year ago&mdash;I lof-a you."
</p>

<p>
Anxiety for Deborah overcame my bewilderment.
I stamped my foot upon
the stage.
</p>

<p>
"Stop this nonsense, Beatrice," I commanded.
"What are you talking about?
Where is Miss Speedwell? Tell me at
once!"
</p>

<p>
The girl thrust a hand into the bosom
of her dress.
</p>

<p>
"You cast-a me off?" she declaimed.
"Den I tell you. Nevair s'all you see
'er again. I desire dat you s'all-a not.
It is me dat 'ave ordered da cabba away.
It is me dat 'ave pris-oned 'er w'ere you
s'all nevair coome. I hate 'er. Dis is
for dem who betr-r-rays an' not care!"
</p>

<p>
She plucked the hand from her dress
and lifted it high. It held a villanous
little stiletto.
</p>

<p>
Of that moment I can never think,
nowadays, without laughing. But at the
time I had no appreciation of absurdities.
I sent a hasty searching glance about the
enclosure. Beyond Beatrice was a door,
and I thought I heard the sound of muffled
sobs behind it. I sprang forward.
On the way I brushed Beatrice aside,
heard a scream, and felt a hot streak upon
my arm; but I was beyond caring for that.
A stroke of my foot burst the lock of the
door, and in another instant I was holding
my sweetheart in my arms.
</p>

<p>
A hurry of footsteps upon the stairs
opposite startled us. The two helpers, the
little faun and another Italian boy rushed
through the door. Beatrice sprang to meet
them. The dagger was still in her hand,
and her eyes were two yellow suns.
</p>

<p>
"Seize him!" she shrieked. "He
has stolen away my father&mdash;who knows
where? Me, he has betrayed! Revenge
my wrong!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But Beatrice was not vouchsafed the
spectacle of a combat in her honor. When
I am thoroughly roused I act promptly,
and I am not a feeble man. I snatched
my arm from Deborah's waist, seized from
the rack the nearest marionette and sent
it flying among Beatrice's lovers. It
struck Anselmo fairly in the chest and laid
him low. Fortunately it was a lady figure
and could hardly have hurt him seriously,
but it smothered him with skirts and hampered
him with strings. The other Italians
watched his struggles for an instant,
and as I made a stride forward, turned
and ran as if the <i>Pagani</i> themselves had
been after them.
</p>

<p>
I snatched Deborah's cape from the
floor, lifted my sweetheart herself, and
sped with her to the street. Once out of
doors, I let her find her own feet, and we
skurried on through the driving rain. It
was a bedraggled maiden that boarded
the electric car with me, but her eyes were
bright and her spirits were firm; she had
even the courage to laugh over the adventure.
</p>

<p>
"The dreadful little creature!" said
Deborah. "She told me I should find
you outside that door, and that she would
bring my cape. But when I had opened
the door, she pushed me through and
locked it after me. I knew you would
come; but it was dark in there, and I&mdash;I
think there were rats."
</p>

<p>
She bent to examine the edge of her
waist, which did not in the least need attention.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you are very strong and brave,
Harry," she murmured.
</p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
That evening won my cause. For
reasons not pertaining to this story, our
wedding was hastened. The month of
preparation was busy, and I am ashamed
to say that I forgot Pietro and his trouble.
Deborah, who never forgets anything, arranged
for Beatrice's invitation to the
farm.
</p>

<p>
During our three years of honeymoon
abroad we spoke almost daily of the child
and her father. A message from the
farmer asking why his guest had not appeared
excited further our curiosity; and
when we returned to New York I devoted
my first unengaged evening to a visit at
the theatre. My wife preferred to remain
at home.
</p>

<p>
The paintings in the foyer were a little
dingy; otherwise the place seemed unchanged.
I rapped upon the door of the
ticket-office.
</p>

<p>
A woman with a baby in her arms answered
my clamor. Her figure was thick
and clumsy, and her clothes were baggy.
After a moment of scrutiny she shifted
the baby to her left arm and extended a
pudgy hand.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, Signore," she said, in a
husky voice. I stared at her face. Her
cheeks had encroached upon her eyes, but
the depths gleamed yellow.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Signore," she replied. "You not-a
know? I am grow up. I am marry."
</p>

<p>
"So I supposed," I stammered. "Ah&mdash;when
did it&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Two year ago. More. My 'usband,
'e is inside. Giovanni, come 'ere."
</p>

<p>
An undersized man shuffled into the
foyer. His legs wavered, and one shoulder
was higher than the other.
</p>

<p>
"'E is tail'. 'E maka da clo'," said Beatrice,
proudly. "We 'ave r-roon off, toget'er.
My father, 'e is so good; 'e' ava
pardon. We live all toget'er. My father
lof-a da <i>bambino</i>. You will see da play?
Giovanni, show de signore da good seat.
No, no! No taka da ten centa."

<h2>
THE SPECTRE IN THE CART
<br />
By Thomas Nelson Page
</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-052.jpg" width="84" height="85" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
I had not seen my friend
Stokeman since we were at
college together, longer ago
than it was pleasant to think
of, and now naturally we
fell to talking of old times.
I remembered him as a hard-headed man
without a particle of superstition, if such
a thing be possible in a land where we are
brought up on superstition, from the bottle.
He was at that time full of life and
of enjoyment of whatever it brought. I
found now that gravity had taken the
place of the gayety for which he was then
noted, and that his wild and almost reckless
spirits had been tempered by the years
which had passed as I should not have
believed possible; for his career had been
an unbroken success, and he appeared to
have proved in his own case his old tenet,
so arrogantly asserted, that no difficulty
could exist which a man's intellect could
not overcome.
</p>

<p>
He used to maintain, I remember, that
there was no apparition or supernatural
manifestation, or series of circumstances
pointing to such a manifestation, however
strongly substantiated they appeared to be,
that could not be explained on purely natural
grounds. And he was wont to say
that he regretted that he had not followed
my profession: Medicine instead of the
Law, that he might study and explain all
such phenomena, and show the folly of
all contrary theories.
</p>

<p>
During our stay at college a somewhat
notable instance of what was by many
supposed to be a supernatural manifestation
occurred in a deserted house on a remote
plantation in an adjoining county.
</p>

<p>
It baffled all investigation, and got into
the newspapers, recalling the Cock Lane
ghost, and many more less celebrated apparitions.
Parties were organized to investigate
it, but were baffled. Stokeman,
on a bet of a box of cigars, volunteered
to go out alone and explode the fraud;
and did so, not only putting the restless
spirit to flight, but capturing it and dragging
it into town as the physical and indisputable
witness both of the truth of
his theory and of his personal courage.
The exploit gave him immense notoriety
in our little world.
</p>

<p>
I was, therefore, now during my visit
to him no little surprised to hear him say
seriously that he had come to understand
how people saw apparitions.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen them myself," he added,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean it?" I sat bolt
upright in my chair in my astonishment.
I had myself, largely through his influence,
become a skeptic in matters relating to
the supernatural.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have seen ghosts. They not
only have appeared to me, but were as
real to my ocular vision as any other external
physical object which I saw with
my eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it was an hallucination.
Tell me; I can explain it."
</p>

<p>
"I explained it myself," he said, dryly.
"But it left me with a little less conceit
and a little more sympathy with the hallucinations
of others not so gifted."
</p>

<p>
It was a fair hit.
</p>

<p>
"In the year &mdash;&mdash;," he went on, after
a brief period of reflection, "I was the
State Attorney for my native county, to
which office I had been elected a few
years after I left college, and the year we
emancipated ourselves from carpet-bag
rule, and I so remained until I was appointed
to the bench. I had a personal
acquaintance, pleasant or otherwise, with
every man in the county. The district was
a close one, and I could almost have given
the census of the population. I knew
every man who was for me and almost
every one who was against me. There
were few neutrals. In those times much
hung on the elections. There was no
borderland. Men were either warmly
for you or hotly against you.
</p>

<p>
"We thought we were getting into
smooth water, where the sailing was clear,
when the storm suddenly appeared about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
to rise again. In the canvass of that year
the election was closer than ever and the
contest hotter.
</p>

<p>
"Among those who went over when the
lines were thus sharply drawn was an old
darky named Joel Turnell, who had been
a slave of one of my nearest neighbors,
Mr. Eaton, and whom I had known all
my life as an easy-going, palavering old
fellow with not much principle, but with
kindly manners and a likable way. He
had always claimed to be a supporter of
mine, being one of the two or three negroes
in the county who professed to vote
with the whites.
</p>

<p>
"He had a besetting vice of pilfering,
for which I had once or twice defended and
got him off, and he appeared to be grateful
to me. I always doubted him a little; for I
believed he did not have force of character
enough to stand up against his people,
and he was a great liar. Still, he was always
friendly with me, and used to claim
the emoluments and privileges of such a
relation. Now, however, on a sudden, in
this campaign he became one of my bitterest
opponents. I attributed it to the influence
of a son of his, named Absalom,
who had gone off from the county during
the war when he was only a youth, and
had stayed away for many years without
anything being known of him, and who
had now returned unexpectedly, and
thrown himself into the fight. He claimed
to have been in the army, and he appeared
to have a deep-seated animosity against
the whites, particularly against all those
whom he had known in boyhood. He
was a vicious-looking fellow, broad-shouldered,
and bow-legged, with a swagger in
his gait. He had an ugly scar on the side
of his throat, evidently made by a knife,
though he told the negroes, I understood,
that he had got it in the war, and was
ready to fight again if he but got the
chance. He had not been back long before
he was in several rows, and as he was
of brutal strength, he began to be much
feared by the negroes. Whenever I heard
of him it was in connection with some fight
among his own people, or some effort to
excite race animosity. When the canvass
began he flung himself into it with fury,
and I must say with marked effect. His
hostility appeared to be particularly directed
against myself, and I heard of him
in all parts of the district declaiming
against me. The Negroes who, for one or
two elections had appeared to have quieted
down and become indifferent as to politics
were suddenly revivified and showed
more feeling than I personally had ever
known them to show. It looked as if the
old scenes of the Reconstruction period,
when the two sides were like hostile armies,
might be witnessed again. Night meetings,
or 'camp-fires,' were held all through
the district, and from all of them came
the report of Absalom Turnell's violent
speeches stirring up the blacks and arraying
them against the whites. Our side
was equally aroused and the whole section
was in a ferment. Our effort was to prevent
any outbreak and tide over the crisis.
</p>

<p>
"Among my friends was a farmer named
John Halloway, one of the best men in my
county, and a neighbor and friend of mine
from my boyhood. His farm, a snug little
homestead of fifty or sixty acres, adjoined
our plantation on one side; and
on the other, that of the Eatons, to whom
Joel Turnell and his son Absalom had belonged,
and I remember that as a boy it
was my greatest privilege and reward to go
over on a Saturday and be allowed by
John Halloway to help him plough, or cut
his hay. He was a big, ruddy-faced, jolly
boy, and even then used to tell me about
being in love with Fanny Peel, who was the
daughter of another farmer in the neighborhood,
and a Sunday-school scholar of
my mother's. I thought him the greatest
man in the world. He had a fight once
with Absalom Turnell when they were both
youngsters, and, though Turnell was much
the heavier, whipped him completely. Halloway
was a good soldier and a good son,
and when he came back from the war and
won his wife, who was a belle among the
young farmers, and with her settled down
on his little place and proceeded to make it
a bower of roses and fruit-trees, there was
not a man around who did not rejoice in
his prosperity and wish him well. The
Halloways had no children and, as is often
the case in such instances, they appeared
to be more to each other than most husbands
and wives. He always spoke of
his wife as if the sun rose and set in her.
No matter where he might be in the county,
when night came he always rode home,
saying that his wife would be expecting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
him. 'Don't keer whether she's asleep
or not,' he used to say, 'she knows I'm
a-comin', and she always hears my click
on the gate-latch, and is waitin' for me.'
</p>

<p>
"It came to be well understood throughout
the county.
</p>

<p>
"'I believe you are henpecked,' said a
man to him one night.
</p>

<p>
"'I believe I am, George,' laughed Halloway,
'and by Jings! I like it too.'
</p>

<p>
"It was impossible to take offence at him,
he was so good-natured. He would get out
of his bed in the middle of the night, hitch
up his horse and pull his bitterest enemy
out of the mud. He had on an occasion
ridden all night through a blizzard to get a
doctor for the wife of a negro neighbor in a
cabin near by who was suddenly taken ill.
When someone expressed admiration for it,
especially as it was known that the man had
not long before been abusing Halloway
to the provost-marshal, who at that time
was in supreme command, he said,
</p>

<p>
"'Well, what's that got to do with it?
Wa'n't the man's wife sick? I don't deserve
no credit, though; if I hadn't gone,
my wife wouldn' 'a' let me come in her
house.' He was an outspoken man, too,
not afraid of the devil, and when he believed
a thing he spoke it, no matter whom
it hit. In this way John had been in
trouble several times while we were under
'gun-rule'; and this, together with his
personal character, had given him great
influence in the county, and made him a
power. He was one of my most ardent
friends and supporters, and to him, perhaps,
more than to any other two men in
the county, I owed my position.
</p>

<p>
"Absalom Turnell's rancorous speeches
had stirred all the county, and the apprehension
of the outbreak his violence was
in danger of bringing might have caused
trouble but for John Halloway's coolness
and level-headedness. John offered to
go around and follow Absalom up at his
meetings. He could 'spike his guns,' he
said. Some of his friends wanted to go
with him. But he said no. The only
condition on which he would go was that
he should go alone.
</p>

<p>
"'You'd better not try that,' they argued.
'That fellow, Ab. Turnell's got it
in for you.'
</p>

<p>
"'They ain't any of 'em going to trouble
me,' said John. 'I know 'em all and I git
along with 'em first rate. I don't know as
I know this fellow Ab.; he's sort o' grown
out o' my recollection; but I want to see.
He knows me, I know. I got my hand
on him once when he was a boy&mdash;about
my age, and he ain't forgot that, I know.
He was a blusterer; but he didn't have
real grit. He won't say nothin' to my
face. But I must go alone. You all are
too flighty.'
</p>

<p>
"So Halloway went alone and followed
Ab. up at his 'camp-fires,' and if report
was true his mere presence served to curb
Ab.'s fury, and take the fire out of his
harangues. Even the negroes got to
laughing and talking about it. Ab. was
just like a dog when a man faced him,
they said; he could not look him in the
eye.
</p>

<p>
"The night before the election there
was a meeting at one of the worst places
in the county, a country store at a point
known as Burley's Fork, and Halloway
went there, alone&mdash;and for the first time
in the canvass thought it necessary to interfere.
Absalom, stung by the taunts of
some of his friends, and having stimulated
himself with mean whiskey, launched out
in a furious tirade against the whites generally,
and me in particular; and called
on the negroes to go to the polls next day
prepared to 'wade in blood to their lips.'
For himself, he said, he had 'drunk
blood' before, both of white men and
women, and he meant to drink it again.
He whipped out and flourished a pistol
in one hand and a knife in the other.
His language exceeded belief, and the negroes,
excited by his violence, were showing
the effect of his wild declamation on
their emotions, and were beginning to respond
with shouts and cries, when Halloway
rose and walked forward. Absalom
turned and started to meet him, yelling
his fury and threats, and the audience
were rising to their feet when they were
stopped. It was described to me afterwards.
Halloway was in the midst of a
powder magazine, absolutely alone, a single
spark would have blown him to atoms
and might have caused a catastrophe
which would have brought untold evil.
But he was as calm as a May morning.
He walked through them, the man who
told me said, as if he did not know there
was a soul in a hundred miles of him, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
as if Absalom were only something to be
swept aside.
</p>

<p>
"'He wa'n't exac'ly laughin', or even
smilin,' he said, 'but he jest looked easy
in his mine.'
</p>

<p>
"They were all waiting, he said, expecting
Absalom to tear him to pieces on the
spot; but as Halloway advanced, Absalom
faltered and stopped. He could not
stand his calm eye. 'It was jest like a dog
givin' way before a man who ain't afraid
of him,' my man said. 'He breshed Absalom
aside as if he had been a fly, and
began to talk to us, and I never heard
such a Speech.'
</p>

<p class="p2">

"I got there just after it happened; for
some report of what Absalom intended to
do had reached me that night and I rode
over hastily, fearing that I might arrive too
late. When, however, I reached the place
everything was quiet, Absalom had disappeared.
Unable to face his downfall,
he had gone off, taking old Joel with him.
The tide of excitement had changed and
the negroes, relieved at the relaxing of the
tension, were laughing among themselves
at their champion's defeat and disavowing
any sympathy with his violence.
They were all friendly with Halloway.
</p>

<p>
"'Dat man wa'n' nothin' but a' outside
nigger, nohow,' they said. 'And he always
was more mouth than anything else,'
etc.
</p>

<p>
"'Good L&mdash;d! He say he want to
drink <i>blood</i>!' declared one man to another,
evidently for us to hear, as we
mounted our horses.
</p>

<p>
"'Drink <i>whiskey</i>!' replied the other,
dryly, and there was a laugh of derision.
</p>

<p>
"I rode home with Halloway. I shall
never forget his serenity. As we passed
along, the negroes were lining the roads
on their way homeward, and were shouting
and laughing among themselves; and the
greetings they gave us as we passed were
as civil and good-humored as if no unpleasantness
had ever existed. A little
after we set out, one man, who had been
walking very fast just ahead of us, and
had been keeping in advance all the
time, slackened his gait and, as we rode
by him, came close to Halloway's stirrup
and said something to him in an undertone.
All I caught was that somebody
was 'layin' up something against him.'
</p>

<p>
"'That's all right, Dick; let him lay
it up, and keep it laid up,' Halloway
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"'Dat's a bad feller!' the negro insisted,
uneasily, his voice kept in an undertone.
'You got to watch him. I'se knowed
him from a boy.' He added something
else in a whisper which I did not catch.
</p>

<p>
"'All right; certainly not! Much
obliged to you, Dick. I'll keep my eyes
open. Good-night.'
</p>

<p>
"'Good-night, gent'men;' and the negro
fell back and began to talk with the
nearest of his companions effusively.
</p>

<p>
"'Who is that?' I asked, for the man
had kept his hat over his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'That's Dick Winchester. You remember
that old fellow 't used to belong to
old Mr. Eaton&mdash;lived down in the pines
back o' me, on the creek 't runs near my
place. His wife died the year of the big
snow.' It was not necessary to explain
further. I remembered the negro for whom
Halloway had ridden through the storm
that night.
</p>

<p>
"I asked him, somewhat irrelevantly, if
he carried a pistol. He said no, he had
never done so.
</p>

<p>
"'Fact is, I'm afraid of killin' somebody.
And I don't want to do that, I know.
Never could bear to shoot my gun even
durin' o' the war, though I shot her 'bout
as often as any of 'em, I reckon&mdash;always
used to shut my eyes right tight whenever
I pulled the trigger. I reckon I was a
mighty pore soldier,' he laughed. (I had
heard that he was one of the best in the
army.)
</p>

<p>
"'Besides, I always feel sort o' cowardly
if I've got a pistol on. Looks like I
was afraid of somebody&mdash;an' I ain't. I've
noticed if two fellows has pistols on and
git to fightin', mighty apt to one git hurt,
maybe both. Sort o' like two dogs growling&mdash;long
as don't but one of 'em growl
it's all right. If don't but one have a pistol,
t'other feller always has the advantage
and sort o' comes out top, while the man
with the pistol looks mean.'
</p>

<p>
"I remember how he looked in the dim
moonlight as he drawled his quaint philosophy.
</p>

<p>
"'I'm a man o' peace, Mr. Johnny, and
I learnt that from your mother&mdash;I learnt
a heap o' things from her,' he added,
presently, after a little period of reflection.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
'She was the lady as used always to have
a kind word for me when I was a boy.
That's a heap to a boy. I used to think
she was an angel. You think it's <i>you</i> I'm
a fightin' for in this canvass? 'Tain't.
I likes you well enough, but I ain't never
forgot your mother, and her kindness to
my old people durin' the war when I was
away. She give me this handkerchief for
a weddin' present when I was married after
the war&mdash;said 'twas all she had to give,
and my wife thinks the world and all of it;
won't let me have it 'cept as a favor; but
this mornin' she told me to take it&mdash;said
'twould bring me luck.' He took a big
bandanna out of his pocket and held it up
in the moonlight. I remembered it as one
of my father's.
</p>

<p>
"'She'll make me give it up to-morrow
night when I git home,' he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"We had turned into the road through
the plantations, and had just come to the
fork where Halloway's road turned off
toward his place.
</p>

<p>
"'I lays a heap to your mother's door&mdash;purty
much all this, I reckon.' His eye
swept the moon-bathed scene before him.
'But for her I mightn't 'a got <i>her</i>. And
ain't a man in the world got a happier
home, or as good a wife.' He waved
his hand toward the little homestead that
was sleeping in the moonlight on the slope
the other side of the stream, a picture of
peace.
</p>

<p>
"His path went down a little slope, and
mine kept along the side of the hill until
it entered the woods. A great sycamore
tree grew right in the fork, with its long,
hoary arms extending over both roads,
making a broad mass of shadow in the
white moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"The next day was the day of the election.
Halloway was at one poll and I
was at another; so I did not see him that
day. But he sent me word that evening
that he had carried his poll, and I rode
home knowing that we should have peace.
</p>

<p class="p2">
"I was awakened next morning by the
news that Halloway and his wife had both
been murdered the night before. I at
once galloped over to his place, and was
one of the first to get there. It was a
horrible sight. Halloway had evidently
been waylaid and killed by a blow of an
axe just as he was entering his yard gate,
and then the door of the house had been
broken open and his wife had been killed,
after which Halloway's body had been
dragged into the house, and the house
had been fired with the intention of making
it appear that the house had burned
by accident. But the house had not
burned down. By one of those inexplicable
fatalities, the fire, after catching
and burning half of two walls, had gone
out. It was a terrible sight, and the room
looked like a shambles. Halloway had
evidently been caught unawares while
leaning over his gate. The back of his
head had been crushed in with the eye of
an axe, and he had died instantly. The
pleasant thought which was in his mind
at the instant&mdash;perhaps of the greeting
that always awaited him on the click of his
latch; perhaps of his success that day;
perhaps of my mother's kindness to him
when he was a boy&mdash;was yet on his face,
stamped there indelibly by the blow that
killed him. There he lay, face upward, as
the murderer had thrown him after bringing
him in, stretched out his full length on
the floor, with his quiet face upturned, looking
in that throng of excited, awe-stricken
men, just what he had said he was: a man
of peace. His wife, on the other hand,
wore a terrified look on her face. There
had been a terrible struggle. She had lived
to taste the bitterness of death, before it
took her." He put his hand over his eyes
as though to shut out the vision that recurred
to him.
</p>

<p>
"In a short time there was a great crowd
there, white and black. The general
mind flew at once to Absalom Turnell.
The negroes present were as earnest in
their denunciation as the whites; perhaps
more so, for the whites were past threatening.
I knew from the grimness that
trouble was brewing, and I felt that if Absalom
were caught and any evidence were
found on him, no power on earth could
save him. A party rode off in search of
him, and went to old Joel's house. Neither
Absalom nor Joel were there; they had
not been home since the election, one of
the women said.
</p>

<p>
"As a law officer of the county I was
to a certain extent in charge at Halloway's,
and in looking around for all the clews
to be found, I came on a small piece of
'light-wood,' as it is called, stuck in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
crack in the floor near the bed: a piece of
a stick of 'fat-pine,' such as negroes often
carry about, and use as tapers&mdash;not as
large or as long as one's little finger. One
end had been burned; but the other end
was clean and was jagged just as it had been
broken off. There was a small scorched
place on the planks on either side, and it
was evident that this was one of the splinters
that had been used in firing the house.
I called a couple of the coolest, most level-headed
men present and quietly showed
them the spot, and they took the splinter
out and preserved it.
</p>

<p>
"By one of those fortuitous chances
which so often happen in every lawyer's
experience, and appear inexplicable, Old
Joel Turnell came up to the house just as
we came out. He was as sympathetic as
possible, appeared outraged at the crime,
and professed the highest regard for Halloway,
and the deepest sorrow at his death.
The sentiment of the crowd was rather
one of sympathy with him, that he should
have such a son as Absalom.
</p>

<p>
"I took the old man aside to have a talk
with him, to find out where his son was and
where he had been the night before. He
was equally vehement in his declarations
of his son's innocence, and of professions
of regard for Halloway. He was indeed
so profuse as to these that he aroused my
suspicion and I questioned him further;
when to my astonishment he declared
that his son had spent the night with him
and had gone away after sunrise.
</p>

<p>
"Then happened one of those fatuous
things that have led to the detection of so
many negroes and can almost be counted
on in their prosecution. Joel took a handkerchief
out of his pocket and wiped his
face, and as he did so I recognized the very
handkerchief Halloway had shown me the
night before. As he pulled out the handkerchief,
Joel drew with it several splinters
of light-wood, one of which had been
broken off from a longer piece and looked
exactly as if it might fit into the piece that
had been stuck in the crack in the floor.
At first, I could scarcely believe my own
senses. But it was the same handkerchief.
Of course, it became my duty to have Joel
arrested immediately. But I was afraid
to have it done there, the crowd was so
deeply incensed. So I called the two men
to whom I had shown the light-wood splinter,
told them the story, and they promised
to get him away and arrest him quietly
and take him safely to jail, which they did.
</p>

<p>
"Even then we did not exactly believe
that the old man had any active complicity
in the crime, and I was blamed
for arresting the innocent old father and
letting the guilty son escape. The son,
however, was arrested shortly afterward.
</p>

<p>
"The circumstances from which the
crime arose gave the case something of a
political aspect, and the prisoners had the
best counsel to be procured, both at our
local bar and in the capital. Thus the
case became a somewhat celebrated one.
The evidence was almost entirely circumstantial,
and when I came to work it up,
I found, as often occurs, that although
the case was plain enough on the outside,
there were many difficulties in the way of
fitting all the circumstances to prove the
guilt of the accused and to make out every
link in the chain. Particularly was this so
in the prosecution of the young man, who
was supposed to be the chief criminal, and
in whose case there was a strong effort to
prove an alibi.
</p>

<p>
"As I worked, I found to my surprise
that the guilt of the old man, though based
wholly on circumstantial evidence, was
established more clearly than that of his
son&mdash;not indeed, as to the murders, but
as to the arson, which served just as well
to convict on. The handkerchief, which
Joel had not been able to resist the temptation
to steal, and the splinter of light-wood
in his pocket, which fitted exactly into
that found in the house, together with
other circumstances, proved his guilt conclusively.
But although there was an
equal moral certainty of the guilt of the
young man, it was not so easy to establish
it by law.
</p>

<p>
"Old Dick Winchester was found dead
one morning and the alibi was almost
completely proved, and only failed by the
incredibility of the witnesses for the defence.
Old Joel persistently declared that
Absalom was innocent, and but for a confession
by Absalom of certain facts intended
to shift the suspicion from himself
to his father, I do not know how his case
might have turned out.
</p>

<p>
"I believed him to be the instigator as
well as the perpetrator of the crime.
</p>

<p>
"I threw myself into the contest, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
prosecuted with all the vigor I was capable
of. And I finally secured the conviction
of both men. But it was after a hard
fight. They were the only instances in
which, representing the Commonwealth, I
was ever conscious of strong personal feeling,
and of a sense of personal triumph.
The memory of my last ride with Halloway,
and of the things he said to me; the
circumstances under which he and his wife
were killed; the knowledge that in some
sort it was on my account; and the bitter
attacks made on me personally (for in some
quarters I was depicted as a bloodthirsty
ruffian, and it was charged that I was for
political reasons prosecuting men whom I
personally knew to be innocent), all combined
to spur me to my utmost effort.
And when the verdicts were rendered, I
was conscious of a sense of personal triumph
so fierce as to shock me.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I did not absolutely believe
in the guilt of both prisoners; for I considered
that I had demonstrated it, and so did
the jurors who tried them.
</p>

<p>
"The day of execution was set. An appeal
was at once taken in both cases and
a stay was granted, and I had to sustain
the verdicts in the upper court. The fact
that the evidence was entirely circumstantial
had aroused great interest, and every
lawyer in the State had his theory. The
upper court affirmed in both cases and appeals
were taken to the next highest court,
and again stay of execution was granted.
</p>

<p>
"The prisoners' counsel had moved to
have the prisoners transferred to another
county, which I opposed. I was sure that
the people of my county would observe
the law. They had resisted the first fierce
impulse, and were now waiting patiently
for Justice to take its course. Months
passed, and the stay of execution had to
be renewed. The road to Halloway's grew
up and I understood that the house had
fallen in, though I never went that way
again. Still the court hung fire as to its
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"The day set for the execution approached
for the third time without the
court having rendered its decision. On
the day before that set for the execution,
the court gave its decision. It refused to
interfere in the case of old Joel, but reversed,
and set aside the verdict in that of
the younger man. Of a series of over one
hundred bills of exception taken by his
counsel as a "drag-net," one held; and
owing to the admission of a single question
by a juror, the judgment was set aside in
Absalom's case and a new trial ordered.

<p>
"The decision of the court was not as
great a surprise to me as it was to the people
generally; still even I was somewhat
surprised, for I had supposed that both
judgments would go together. The court
came in for a good deal of abuse, and it
was declared by many that they had
hanged the wrong man.
</p>

<p>
"Being anxious lest the excitement
might increase, I felt it my duty to stay at
the county-seat that night, and as I could
not sleep I spent the time going over the
records of the two cases; which, like most
causes, developed new points every time
they were read. I found myself fascinated
by them.
</p>

<p>
"Everything was perfectly quiet all
night, though the village was filling up with
people from the country to see the execution,
which at that time was still public.
I determined next morning to go to my
home in the country and get a good rest,
of which I began to feel the need. I was
detained, however, and it was well along
in the forenoon before I mounted my
horse and rode slowly out of town through
a back street. The lane kept away from
the main road except at one point just
outside of town, where it crossed it at
right angles.
</p>

<p>
"It was a beautiful spring day&mdash;a day
in which it is a pleasure merely to live,
and as I rode along through the quiet
lane under the leafy trees I could not help
my mind wandering and dwelling on the
things that were happening. I am not
sure, indeed, that I was not dozing; for
I reached the highway without knowing
just where I was.
</p>

<p>
"I was recalled to myself by a rush of
boys up the street before me, and a crowd
behind them. And there at that moment,
coming slowly along before me, was the
head of the procession, the sheriff and his
men riding, with set faces, in front and on
both sides of a slowly moving vehicle, and
in a common horse-cart in the midst of
his guards, dressed in his Sunday clothes,
with a clean white shirt on, seated on his
pine coffin, was old Joel. I unconsciously
gazed at him, and at the instant he looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
up and saw me. Our eyes met as naturally
as if he had expected to find me there,
and he gave me as natural and as friendly
a bow, not a particle reproachful; but a
little timid, as though he did not quite
know whether I would speak to him.
</p>

<p>
"It gave me a tremendous shock. I
had a sudden sinking of the heart, and
nearly fell from my horse. I turned and
rode away; but I could not shake off the
feeling. I tried to reassure myself with the
reflection that he had committed a terrible
crime. It did not compose me. What
insisted on coming to my mind was the
eagerness with which I had prosecuted
him and the joy I had felt at my success.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I know now it was simply
that I was overworked and needed rest;
but at that time the trouble was serious.
</p>

<p>
"It haunted me all day, and that night
I could not sleep; and for many days
after, it clung to me, and I found myself
unable to forget it, or to sleep as I had
been used to do.
</p>

<p>
"The new trial of Absalom came on in
time, and the fight was had all over again.
It was longer than before, as every man
in our county had an opinion, and a jury
had to be brought from another county.
But again the verdict was the same. And
again an appeal was taken; was refused
by the next higher court; and allowed by
the highest; this time because a talesman
said he had expressed an opinion, but had
not formed one. And in time the appeal
was heard once more, and after much delay,
due to the number of cases on the
docket and the immense labor of studying
carefully so huge a record it was decided.
It was again reversed, on the technicality
mentioned, and a new trial ordered.
</p>

<p>
"That same day the court adjourned for
its term.
</p>

<p>
"Sentiment is a curious thing. The apparent
injustice of the fact that old Joel
was sentenced to be hanged, while his son,
who was universally believed to be the instigator
of the crime, was given another
chance for his life, affected many people,
and a strong effort was made to get his
sentence commuted; some, even of those
who had been most earnest in their denunciation
of him, turned, and petitions
were got up recommending him for executive
clemency. One was brought to
me, and every argument was used to induce
me to sign it. I was satisfied of
his guilt, and refused.
</p>

<p>
"Having a bedroom adjoining my office,
I spent that night in town. I did not go
to sleep until late, and had not been asleep
long when I was awakened by the continual
repetition of a monotonous sound.
At first I thought I was dreaming, but as
I aroused it came to me distinctly: the
sound of blows in the distance struck regularly.
I awaked fully. The noise was in
the direction of the jail. I dressed hastily
and went down on the street. I stepped
into the arms of a half-dozen masked men
who quietly laid me on my back, blindfolded
me and bound me so that I could
not move. I threatened and struggled;
but to no purpose, and finally gave it up
and tried expostulation. They told me
that they intended no harm to me; but
that I was their prisoner and they meant
to keep me. They had come for their
man, they said, and they meant to have
him. They were perfectly quiet and acted
with the precision of old soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"All the time I could hear the blows at
the jail as the mob pounded the iron door
with sledges, and now and then a shout
or cry from within. Then one great roar
went up and the blows ceased suddenly,
and then one cry.
</p>

<p>
"The blows were on the inner door, for
the mob had gained access to the outer.
They had come prepared and, stout as the
door was, it could not resist long.
</p>

<p>
"In a little while I heard the regular
tramp of men, and in a few minutes the
column came up the street, marching like
soldiers. There must have been five
hundred of them. The prisoner was in
the midst, bare-headed and walking between
two mounted men, and was moaning
and pleading and cursing by turns.
</p>

<p>
"I asked my captors if I might speak,
and they gave me ten minutes. I stood
up on the top step of the house, and for a
quarter of an hour I made what I consider
to have been the best speech I ever
made or shall make. I told them in closing
that I should use all my powers to find
out who they were, and if I could I should
prosecute them, every one, and try and
have them hanged for murder.
</p>

<p>
"They heard me patiently, but without
a word, and when I was through, one of
the leaders made a short reply. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
agreed with me about the law; but they
felt that the way it was being used was
such as to cause a failure of justice. They
had waited patiently, and were apparently
no nearer seeing justice executed than in
the beginning. So they proposed to take
the law into their own hands. The remedy
was, to do away with all but proper defences
and execute the law without unreasonable
delay.
</p>

<p>
"It was the first mob I had ever seen,
and I experienced a sensation of utter
powerlessness and insignificance; just as
in a vast disturbance of the elements&mdash;a
storm at sea, a hurricane, a conflagration.
The individual disappeared before the irresistible
force.
</p>

<p>
"An order was given and the column
moved on silently.
</p>

<p>
"A question arose among my guards as
to what should be done with me.
</p>

<p>
"They wished to pledge me to return to
my rooms and take no steps until morning,
but I would give no pledges. So
they took me along with them. From the
time they started there was not a word
except the orders of the leader and his
lieutenants and the occasional outcry of
the prisoner, who prayed and cursed by
turns.
</p>

<p>
"They went out of the village and turned
in at Halloway's place.
</p>

<p>
"Here the prisoner made his last struggle.
The idea of being taken to Halloway's
place appeared to terrify him to desperation.
He might as well have struggled
against the powers of the Infinite. He
said he would confess everything if they
would not take him there. They said they
did not want his confession. He gave
up, and from this time was quiet; and
he soon began to croon a sort of hymn.
</p>

<p>
"The procession stopped at the big
sycamore under which I had last parted
from Halloway.
</p>

<p>
"I asked leave to speak again; but they
said no. They asked the prisoner if he
wanted to say anything. He said he
wanted something to eat. The leader said
he should have it; that it should never be
said that any man&mdash;even he&mdash;had asked
in vain for food in that county.
</p>

<p>
"Out of a haversack food was produced
in plenty, and while the crowd waited
amidst profound silence, the prisoner squatted
down and ate up the entire plateful.
</p>

<p>
"Then the leader said he had just five
minutes more to live, and he had better
pray.
</p>

<p>
"He began a wild sort of incoherent
ramble; confessed that he had murdered
Halloway and his wife, but laid the chief
blame on his father, and begged them to
tell his friends to meet him in Heaven.
</p>

<p>
"I asked leave to go, and it was given
me on condition that I would not return
for twenty minutes. This I agreed to. I
went to my home and aroused someone,
and we returned. It was not much more
than a half hour since I had left, but the
place was deserted. It was all silent as
the grave. There was no living creature
there. Only under the great sycamore,
from one of its long, pale branches that
stretched across the road, hung that dead
thing just out of our reach, turning and
swaying a little in the night wind.
</p>

<p>
"We had to climb to the limb to cut
the body down.
</p>

<p>
"The outside newspapers made a good
deal of the affair. I was charged with indifference,
with cowardice, with venality.
Some journals even declared that I had
instigated the lynching and participated in
it, and said that I ought to be hanged.
</p>

<p>
"I did not mind this much. It buoyed
me up, and I went on with my work without
stopping for a rest, as I had intended
to do.
</p>

<p>
"I kept my word and ransacked the
county for evidence against the lynchers.
Many knew nothing about the matter;
others pleaded their privilege and refused
to testify on the ground of self-crimination.
</p>

<p>
"The election came on again, and almost
before I knew it I was in the midst
of the canvass.
</p>

<p>
"I held that election would be an indorsement
of me, and defeat would be a
censure. After all, it is the endorsement
of those about our own home that we
desire.
</p>

<p>
"The night before the election I spoke
to a crowd at Burley's Fork. The place
had changed since Halloway checked
Absalom Turnell there. A large crowd
was in attendance. I paid Halloway my
personal tribute that night, and it met with
a deep response. I denounced the lynching.
There was a dead silence. I was
sure that in my audience were many of the
men who had been in the mob that night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"When I rode home quite a company
started with me.
</p>

<p>
"The moon, which was on the wane,
was, I remember, just rising as we set out.
It was a soft night, rather cloudy, but not
dark, for the sad moon shone a little now
and then, looking wasted and red. The
other men dropped off from time to time
as we came to the several roads that led to
their homes and at last I was riding alone.
I was dead tired, and after I was left by
my companions sat loungingly on my
horse, and my mind ran on the last canvass
and the strange tragedy that ended
it, with its train of consequences. I was
not aware when my horse turned off from
the main road into the by-road that led
through the Halloway place to my own
home. It was the same horse I had ridden
that night. I waked suddenly to a realization
of where I was, and regretted for
a second that I had come by that road.
The next moment I put the thought away
as a piece of cowardice and rode on, my
mind perfectly easy. My horse presently
broke into a canter and I took a train of
thought distinctly pleasant. I mention
this to account for my inability to explain
what followed. I was thinking of old
times and of a holiday I had spent once
at Halloway's when old Joel came through
on his way to his wife's house. It was
the first time I ever remembered seeing
Joel. I was suddenly conscious of something
white moving on the road before
me. At the same second my horse suddenly
wheeled with such violence as to
break my stirrup-leather and almost throw
me over his neck. I pulled him up and
turned him back, and there before me, coming
along the unused road up the hill from
Halloway's, was old Joel, sitting in a cart,
looking at me, and bowing to me politely
just as he had done that morning on
his way to the gallows; while dangling
from the white limb of the sycamore,
swaying softly in the wind, hung the corpse
of Absalom. At first I thought it was an
illusion and I rubbed my eyes. But
there they were. Then I thought it was
a delusion; and I reined in my horse and
reasoned about it. But it was not; for I
saw both men as plainly as I saw my
stirrup-leather lying there in the middle
of the road, and in the same way. My
horse saw them too, and was so terrified
that I could not keep him headed to
them. Again and again I pulled him
around and looked at the men and tried
to reason about them; but every time I
looked there they were, and my horse
snorted and wheeled in terror. I could
see the clothes they wore; the clean,
white shirt and neat Sunday suit old Joel
had on, and the striped, hickory shirt, torn
on the shoulders, and the gray trousers
that the lynched man wore&mdash;I could see
the white rope wrapt around the limb and
hanging down, and the knot at his throat;
I remembered them perfectly. I could
not get near the cart, for the road down
to Halloway's, on which it moved steadily
without ever approaching, was stopped
up. But I rode right under the limb on
which the other man hung, and there it
was just above my head. I reasoned with
myself, but in vain. There it still hung
silent and real, swinging gently in the
night wind and turning a little back and
forth at the end of the white rope.
</p>

<p>
"In sheer determination to fight it
through I got off my horse and picked up
my stirrup. He was trembling like a leaf.
I remounted and rode back to the spot
and looked again, confident that the
spectres would now have disappeared.
But there they were, old Joel, sitting in
his cart, bowing to me civilly with timid,
sad, friendly eyes, as much alive as I was,
and the dead man, with his limp head and
arms, hanging in mid-air and turning in
the wind.
</p>

<p>
"I rode up under the dangling body and
cut at it with my switch. At the motion
my horse bolted. He ran fully a mile before
I could pull him in.
</p>

<p>
"The next morning I went to my stable
to get my horse to ride to the polls. The
man at the stable said:
</p>

<p>
"'He ain't fit to take out, sir. You
must 'a gin him a mighty hard ride last
night&mdash;he won't tetch a moufful; he's
been in a cold sweat all night.'
</p>

<p>
"Sure enough, he looked it.
</p>

<p>
"I took another horse and rode out by
Halloway's to see the place by daylight.
It was quiet enough now.
</p>

<p>
"The sycamore shaded the grass-grown
road, and a branch, twisted and broken
by some storm, hung by a strip of bark
from the big bough that stretched across
the road above my head, swaying, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
limp leaves, a little in the wind; a dense
dogwood bush in full bloom among the
young pines, filled a fence-corner down
the disused road where old Joel had bowed
to me from his phantom cart the night before.
But it was hard to believe that these
were the things which had created such
impressions on my mind&mdash;as hard to believe
as that the quiet cottage peering out
from amid the mass of peach-bloom was
one hour the home of such happiness, and
the next the scene of such a tragedy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have seen apparitions," he said,
thoughtfully, "but I have seen what was
worse."

Once more he put his hands suddenly
before his face as though to shut out
something from his vision.

THE TRAIL OF THE SANDHILL STAG

<p class="drop-cap">
It was a burning hot day. Yan was
wandering in pursuit of birds among
the endless groves and glades of the
Sandhill wilderness about Carberry.
The water in the numerous marshy ponds
was warm with the sunheat, so Yan cut
across to the trail spring, the only place in
the country where he might find a cooling
drink. As he stooped beside it his eye fell
on a small hoof-mark in the mud, a sharp
and elegant track. He had never seen one
like it before, but it gave him a thrill, for he
knew at once it was the track of a <i>wild deer</i>.
</p>

<p>
"There are no deer in those hills now,"
the settlers told Yan. Yet when the first
snow came that autumn he, remembering
the hoof-mark in the mud, quietly took
down his rifle and said to himself, "I am
going into the hills every day till I bring
out a deer." Yan was a tall, raw lad in
the last of his teens. He was no hunter
yet, but he was a tireless runner, and filled
with unflagging zeal. Away to the hills
he went on his quest, day after day, and
many a score of long white miles he
coursed, and night after night he returned
to the shanty without seeing even a track.
But the longest chase will end. On a far,
hard trip in the southern hills he came at
last on the trail of a deer&mdash;dim and stale,
but still a deer-trail&mdash;and again he felt a
thrill as the thought came, "At the other
end of that line of dimples in the snow is
the creature that made them; each one
is fresher than the last, and it is only a
question of time for me to come up with
their maker."
</p>

<p>
At first Yan could not tell by the dim
track which way the animal had gone.
But he soon found that the mark was a little
sharper at one end, and rightly guessed
that that was the toe; also he noticed that
the spaces shortened in going up hill, and
at last a clear imprint in a sandy place
ended the doubt.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-064b.jpg" width="44" height="67" alt="Hare" />
</div>

<p>
Away he went with a new fire in his
blood, and an odd prickling in his hair;
away on a long hard follow through interminable
woods and hills, with the trail
growing fresher as he flew. All day he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
followed, and toward night it turned and
led him homeward. On it went, soon
over familiar ground, back to the saw-mill,
then over Mitchell's Plain, and at
last into the thick poplar woods nearby,
where Yan left it when it was too dark to
follow. He was only seven miles from
home, and this he easily trotted in an hour.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he was back to take it
up, but instead of an old track, there were
now so many fresh ones, crossing and
winding, that he could not follow at all.
So he prowled along haphazard, until he
found two tracks so new that he could
easily trail them as before, and he eagerly
gave chase.
</p>

<p>
As he sneaked along watching the tracks
at his feet instead of the woods ahead,
he was startled by two big-eared, grayish
animals, springing from a little glade into
which he had stumbled. They trotted to
a bank fifty yards away and then turned
to gaze at him.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-065.jpg" width="327" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The way they would rise in air by a tiny toe-touch was bewildering.&mdash;<a href="#Page_193">Page 193</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
How they did seem to <i>look</i> with their
great ears. How they spell-bound him
by the soft gaze that he felt rather than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
saw! He knew what they were. Had
he not for weeks been holding ready, preparing
and hungering for this very sight!
And yet how useless were his preparations;
how wholly all his preconcepts
were swept away, and a wonder-stricken
"Oh-h-h!" went softly from his throat.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-066a.jpg" width="493" height="337" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Straining his eyes in vain to see some form that he might shoot.&mdash;<a href="#Page_196">Page 196</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
As he stood and gazed, they turned
their heads away, though they still seemed
to look at him with their great ears, and
trotting a few steps to a smoother place,
began to bound up and down in a sort of
play. They seemed to have forgotten
him, and the wonderful effortless way in
which they would rise six or eight feet in
air by a tiny toe-touch was bewildering.
Yan stood fascinated by the strange play
of the light-limbed, gray-furred creatures.
</p>

<p>
There was no haste or alarm in their
movements, he would watch them until
they began to run away&mdash;till they should
take fright and begin the labored straining,
the vast athletic bounds, he had heard
of. And it was only on noting that they
were rapidly fading into the distance that
he realized that <i>now</i> they were running
away, <i>already</i> were flying for safety.
</p>

<p>
Higher and higher they rose each time;
gracefully their bodies swayed inward as
they curved along some bold ridge, or for
a long space the buff-white 'scutcheons
that they bore behind them seemed hanging
in the air, while these wingless birds
were really sailing over a deep gully.
</p>

<p>
Yan stood intensely gazing until they
were out of sight, and it never once occurred
to him to shoot.
</p>

<p>
When they were gone he went to the
place where they had begun their play.
Here was one track, where was the next?
He looked all around and was surprised
to see a blank for fifteen feet; and then
another blank, and on farther, another:
then the blanks increased to eighteen
feet, then to twenty, then to twenty-five
and sometimes thirty feet. Each of these
playful, effortless bounds covered a space
of eighteen to thirty feet.
</p>

<p>
Gods above! They do not run at all,
they fly; and once in awhile come down
again to tap the hill-tops with their dainty
hoofs.

<p>
"I'm glad they got away,"
said Yan. "They've shown
me something to-day that
never man saw before. I
know that no one else has
ever, ever seen it, or he
would have told of it."

</h3>

<p>
Yet when the morning came the old
wolfish instinct was back in his heart.
"I must away to the hills," he said, "take
up the trail, and be a beast of the chase
once more; my wits against their wits;
my strength against their strength; and
against their speed, my gun."
</p>

<p>
Oh! those glorious sand-hills&mdash;an
endless rolling stretch of
sandy dunes, with lakes and
woods and grassy lawns between.
Life&mdash;life, on every side, and life
within, for Yan was young and
strong and joyed in powers complete,
and he said, "These are
the best days of my life, these are
my golden days." He thought
it then, and oh, how well he came to know
it in the after years!
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-067b.jpg" width="83" height="131" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The seasons round.</p>
</div>

<p>
All day at a long wolf-lope he would go
and send the white hare and the partridge
flying from his path, and swing along and
scan the ground for sign and the tell-tale
inscript in the snow, the oldest of all writing,
more thrillful of interest by far than
the finest glyph or scarab that ever Egypt
gave to modern day.
</p>

<p>
But the driving snow was the wild deer's
friend, as the driven snow was his foe, and
down it came that day and wiped out
every trace.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-067c.jpg" width="154" height="345" alt="Tracks" />
</div>

<p>
The next day and the next still found
Yan careering in the hills, but never a track
or sign did he see. And the weeks went
by and many a rolling mile he ran and
many a bitter day and freezing
night he passed in the snowclad
hills, sometimes on a deer-trail
but more often without. Sometimes
in the barren hills, and
sometimes led by woodmen's talk
to far-off sheltering woods, and
once or twice he saw indeed the
buff-white bannerets go floating
up the hills. Sometimes reports
came of a great buck that frequented
the timberlands near the saw-mill,
and more than once Yan found his
trail, but never got a glimpse of him;
and the few deer there were, now grew
so wild with long pursuit that he had no
further chances to shoot, and the hunting
season passed in one long train of failures.
Bright, unsad failures they, for every
day on the trail was a glad triumphant
march.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He seemed indeed to come back empty-handed,
but he really came home laden
with the best spoils of the chase.
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The year went by. Another season
came, and Yan felt in his heart the hunter
fret once more. Even had he not, the talk
he heard would have set him all afire.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-068a.jpg" width="518" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The doe was walking slowly, with hanging head and ears.&mdash;<a href="#Page_201">Page 201</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
It told of a mighty buck that now lived
in the hills&mdash;the Sandhill Stag they called
him. It told of his size, his speed, and the
crowning glory that he bore on his brow, a
marvellous growth like sculptured bronze
with gleaming ivory points.
</p>

<p>
So when the first tracking snow came,
Yan set out with some comrades who had
caught a faint reflected glow of his ardor.
They drove in a sleigh to the Spruce Hill,
then scattered to meet again at sunset.
The woods about abounded in hares and
grouse, and the powder burned all around.
But no deer-track was to be found, so Yan
quietly left the woods and set off alone for
Kennedy's Plain, where last this wonderful
buck had been seen.
</p>

<p>
After a few miles he came on a great
deer-track, so large and sharp and broken
by such mighty bounds that he knew it at
once for the trail of the Sandhill Stag.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden rush of strength to his
limbs he led away like a wolf on the trail.
And down his spine and in his hair he felt
as before, and yet as never before, the
strange prickling that he knew was the
same as makes the wolf's mane bristle
when he hunts. He followed till night
was near and he must needs turn, for the
Spruce Hill was many miles away.
</p>

<p>
He knew that it would be long after
sunset before he could get there, and he
scarcely expected that his comrades would
wait for him, but he did not care; he gloried
in the independence of his strength,
for his legs were like iron and his wind
was like a hound's. Ten miles were no
more to him than a mile to another man,
for he could run all day
and come home fresh, and
always when alone in the
lone hills he felt within so
glad a gush of wild exhilaration
that his joy was
full.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-068b.jpg" width="129" height="213" alt="Winter Scene" />
</div>

<p>
So when his friends, feeling
sure that he could take
care of himself, drove home
and left him, he was glad
to be left. They seemed
rather to pity him for imposing
on himself such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
long, toilsome tramps. They
had no realization of what
he found in those wind-swept
hills. They never once
thought what they, and all
their friends and every man
that ever lived has striven
for and offered his body, his
brain, his freedom and his
life to buy; what they were
vainly wearing out their lives
in fearful, hopeless drudgery
to gain, that boy was daily finding in those
hills. The bitter, biting, blizzard wind was
without, but the fire of health and youth
was within; and at every stride in his
daily march, it was <i>happiness</i> he found,
and he knew it. And he smiled such a
gentle smile when he thought
of them driven home in the
sleigh shivering and miserable,
yet pitying him.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-069a.jpg" width="102" height="160" alt="Bird on Branch" />
</div>

<p>
Oh! what a glorious sunset
he saw that day on Kennedy's
Plain, with the snow dyed pink
and the poplar woods aglow
in red and gold. What a glorious
tramp through the darkening
woods as the shadows fell and the yellow
moon came up!
</p>

<p>
"These are the best days of my life,"
he said. "These are my golden days!"
</p>

<p>
And as he neared the great Spruce Hill,
Yan yelled a long hurrah! "In case they
are still there," he told himself, but really
for very joy of feeling all alive.
</p>

<p>
As he listened for the improbable response,
he heard a faint howling of wolves
away over Kennedy's Plain. He mimicked
their cry and quickly got response,
and noticed that they were gathering
together, doubtless hunting something, for
now it was their hunting cry. Nearer and
nearer it came, and his howls brought
ready answers from the gloomy echoing
woods, when suddenly it flashed upon
him: "It's <i>my</i> trail you are on. <i>You are
hunting me.</i>"
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-069b.jpg" width="113" height="111" alt="Animal" />
</div>

<p>
The road now led across a little open
plain. It would have been madness to
climb a tree in such a fearful frost, so he
went out to the middle of the
open place and sat down in the
moonlit snow&mdash;a glittering rifle
in his hands, a row of shiny
brass pegs in his belt, and a
strange new feeling in his heart. On came
the chorus, a deep, melodious howling, on
to the very edge of the woods, and there
the note changed. Then there was silence.
They must have seen him sitting there for
the light was like day, but they went around
in the edge of the woods. A stick snapped
to the right and a low '<i>woof</i>' came from
the left. Then all was still. Yan felt them
sneaking around, felt them watching him
from the cover and straining his eyes in
vain to see some form that he might shoot.
But they were wise, and he was wise, for
had he run he would soon have seen them
closing in on him. They must have been
but few, for after their council of war they
decided he was better let alone, and he
never saw them at all. For twenty minutes
he waited, but hearing no
more of them arose and went
homeward. And as he tramped
he thought, "Now I know how
a deer feels, when the grind of
a moccasined foot or the click
of lock are heard in the trail
behind him."
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-069c.jpg" width="82" height="83" alt="Winter Scene" />
</div>

<p>
In the days that followed he
learned those sandhills well, for
many a frosty day and bitter night he spent
in them. He learned to follow fast the
faintest trail of deer. He learned just why
that trail went never past a tamarac-tree and
why it pawed the snow at every oak, and
why the buck's is plainest and the fawn's
down wind. He learned just what the
club-rush has to say, when its tussocks
break the snow. He came to know how
the muskrat lives beneath the ice and why
the mink slides down a hill, and what the
ice says when it screams at night. The
squirrels taught him how best a fir-cone
can be stripped, and which of toad-stools
one might eat. The partridge, why it
dives beneath the snow, and the fox, just
why he sets his feet so straight, and why
he wears so huge a tail.
</p>

<p>
He learned the ponds, the woods, the
hills and a hundred secrets of the trail,
but&mdash;<i>he got no deer</i>.
</p>

<p>
And though many a score of crooked
frosty miles he coursed, and sometimes
had a track to lead and sometimes none,
he still went on, like Galahad when the
Grail was just before him. For more than
once, the guide that led was the trail of
the Sandhill Stag.

</h3>

<p>
The hunt was nearly over, for the season's
end was coming. The moose-birds
had picked the last of the saskatoons, all
the spruce-cones were scaled, and the
hunger-moon was near. But a hopeful
chicadee sang "<i>see soon</i>" as Yan set off
one frosty day for the great Spruce Woods.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-070b.jpg" width="161" height="83" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
On the road he overtook a woodcutter,
who told him that at such a place he had
seen two deer last night, a doe and a
monstrous stag, with "a rocking-chair on
his head."
</p>

<p>
Straight to the
very place went
Yan and found the
tracks. One like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
those he had seen in the mud long ago,
another a large unmistakable print, the
mark of the Sandhill Stag.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-071a.jpg" width="516" height="119" alt="Tracks" />
</div>

<p>
How the wild beast in his heart did
ramp&mdash;he wanted to howl like a wolf on a
hot scent; and away they went through
woods and hills, the trail and Yan and the
inner wolf.
</p>

<p>
All day he followed and, grown crafty
himself, remarked each sign, and rejoiced
to find that nowhere had the deer been
bounding. And when the sun was low
the sign was warm, so laying aside unneeded
things, Yan crawled along like a
snake on the track of a hare. All day the
animals had zigzagged as they fed; their
drink was snow, and now at length away
across a lawn in a bank of brush Yan
spied a <i>something</i> flash. A bird perhaps;
he lay still and watched. Then gray among
the gray brush, he made out a great log,
and from one end of it rose two gnarled
oaken boughs. Again the flash&mdash;the move
of a restless ear, then the oak-boughs
moved and Yan trembled, for he knew
that the log in the brush was the form of
the Sandhill Stag. So grand, so charged
with <i>life</i>. He seemed a precious, sacred
thing&mdash;a King, fur-robed and duly
crowned. To think of shooting now as he
lay unconscious, resting, seemed an awful
crime. But Yan for weeks and months
had pined for this. His chance had come
and shoot he must. The long, long strain
grew tighter yet&mdash;grew taut&mdash;broke down,
as up the rifle went. But the wretched
thing went wabbling and pointing all about
the little glade. His breath came hot and
fast and choking&mdash;so much, so very much&mdash;so
clearly all, hung on a single touch.
He laid the rifle down, revulsed&mdash;and
trembled in the snow. But he soon regained
the mastery, his hand was steady
now, the sights in line&mdash;'twas but a deer
lying out there. But at that moment, the
stag turned full Yan's way, with those regardful
eyes and ears, and nostrils too, and
gazed.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-071c.jpg" width="60" height="55" alt="Crown" />
</div>

<p>
"Darest thou slay me?" said an uncrowned,
unarmed king once, as his eyes
fell on the assassin's knife, and in that clear,
calm gaze the murderer quailed and cowed.
</p>

<p>
So trembled Yan; but he knew it was
only stag-fever,
and he despised
it then as he
came in time to honor it; and the beast
that dwelt within him fired the gun.
</p>

<p>
The ball splashed short. The buck
sprang up and the doe appeared. Another
shot, then as they fled, another and
another. But away the deer went, lightly
drifting across the low round hills.
</p>

<p>
They say a wild beast cannot look a
man in the eyes; Yan found it hard to
look a wild beast in the eyes when he was
trying to take its life.
</p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
He followed their trail for some time,
but gnashed his teeth to find no sign of
blood, and he burnt with a raging animal
sense that was neither love nor hate.
Within a mile there was a new sign that
joined on and filled him with another rage
and shed light on many a bloody page
of frontier history, a moccasin-track, a
straight-set, broad-toed, moosehide track,
the track of a Cree brave. He followed
in savage humor, and as he careered up
a slope a tall form rose from a log, raising
one hand in peaceable gesture. Although
Yan was behind, the Indian
had seen him first.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" said Yan,
roughly.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-071b.jpg" width="94" height="120" alt="Tomahawk" />
</div>

<p>
"Chaska."
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing in
my country?"
</p>

<p>
"It was my country first," he replied,
gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Those are my deer," Yan said, and
thought.
</p>

<p>
"No man owns deer till he kills them,"
said Chaska.
</p>

<p>
"You better keep off any trail I'm following."
</p>

<p>
"Not afraid," said he, and made a gesture
to include the whole settlement, then
added, gently, "No good to fight, the
best man will get the most deer anyhow."
</p>

<p>
And the end of it was that Yan stayed
for several days with Chaska and got, not
an antlered buck indeed, but, better far,
an insight into the ways of a man who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
could hunt. The Indian taught him <i>not</i>
to follow the trail over the hills, for deer
watch their back track, and cross the hills
to make this more easy. He taught him
to tell by touch and smell of sign just how
far ahead they are, as well as the size and
condition of the deer, and not to trail
closely when the game is near. He taught
him to study the wind by raising his
moistened finger in the air, and Yan
thought, "Now I know why a deer's nose
is always moist, for he must always watch
the wind." He showed Yan
how much may be gained by
patient waiting at times, and that
it is better to tread like an Indian
with foot set straight, for thereby
one gains an inch or two at each
stride and can come back in
one's own track through deep
snow. And he also unwittingly taught
him that an Indian <i>cannot</i> shoot with a
rifle, and Natty Bumpo's adage came to
mind, "A white man can shoot with a gun,
but it ain't accordin' to an Injun's gifts."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes they went out together and
sometimes singly. One day while out
alone Yan had followed a deer-track into
a thicket by what is now called Chaska
Lake. The sign was fresh, and as he
sneaked around there was a rustle in the
brush. Then he saw the kinnikinic
boughs shaking. His gun flew up and
covered the spot. As soon as he was sure
of the place he meant to fire. But when
he saw the creature as a dusky moving
form through the twigs, he awaited a
better view, which came, and he had almost
pulled the trigger when his hand was
stayed by a glimpse of red, and a moment
later out stepped&mdash;Chaska.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-072a.jpg" width="78" height="101" alt="Indian" />
</div>

<p>
"Chaska," Yan gasped, "I nearly did
for you."
</p>

<p>
For reply the Indian drew his finger
across the red handkerchief on his brow.
Yan knew then one reason why a hunting
Indian always wears it; after that he wore
one himself.
</p>

<p>
One day a flock of prairie chickens flew
high overhead toward the thick Spruce
woods. Others followed and it seemed to
be a general move. Chaska looked toward
them and said, "Chickens go hide in
bush. Blizzard to-night."
</p>

<p>
It surely came, and the hunters stayed
all day by the fire. Next day it was as
fierce as ever. On the third day it ceased
somewhat and they hunted again. But
Chaska returned with his gun broken by
a fall, and after a long silent smoke he
said:
</p>

<p>
"Yan hunt in Moose Mountain?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Good hunting. Go?"
</p>

<p>
Yan shook his head.
</p>

<p>
Presently the Indian, glancing to east,
said, "Sioux tracks there to-day. All
bad medicine here." And Yan knew that
his mind was made up. He went away
and they never met again. Like everything
Indian, he is gone, his family is
gone, his hunting grounds are gone, and
to-day all that is left of him is his name,
borne by the lonely lake that lies in the
Carberry Hills.
</p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
"There are more deer round Carberry
now than ever before, and the Big Stag
has been seen between Kennedy's Plain
and the mill." So said a note that reached
Yan away in the east where he had been
chafing in a new and distasteful life. It
was the beginning of the hunting season,
the fret was already in his blood, and that
letter decided him. For awhile the iron
horse, for awhile the gentle horse, then he
donned his moosehide wings and flew as
of old on many a long hard flight to return
as so often before.
</p>

<p>
Then he heard that at a certain lake far
to the eastward seven deer had been seen;
their leader a wonderful buck.
</p>

<p>
With three others he set out in a sleigh
to the eastward lake and soon found the
tracks. Six of various sizes and one large
one, undoubtedly that of the famous Stag.
</p>

<p>
How utterly the veneer was torn to tatters
by those seven chains of tracks. How
completely the wild paleolithic beast stood
revealed in each of the men, in spite of
semi-modern garb, as they drove away on
the trail with a wild excited gleam in every
eye.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-072b.jpg" width="108" height="60" alt="Train" />
</div>

<p>
It was nearly night before the trail
warmed up, but even then, in spite of
Yan's earnest protest, they drove on in the
sleigh. And soon they came to where the
trail told of seven keen observers looking
backward from a hill, then an even sevenfold
chain of twenty-five foot bounds. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
hunters got no glimpse at all, but followed
till the night came down, then hastily
camped in the snow.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-073a.jpg" width="379" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">To scan the white world for his foe.&mdash;<a href="#Page_203">Page 203</a>.
</p></div>

<p>
In the morning they followed as before,
and soon came to where seven spots of
black, bare ground showed where the deer
had slept.
</p>

<p>
Now when the trail grew warm Yan
insisted on hunting on foot. He trailed
the deer into a great thicket and knew just
where they were by a grouse that flew
cackling from its farther side.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-073b.jpg" width="84" height="96" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
He arranged a plan, but his friends
would not await the blue-jay's "all-right
note," and the deer escaped.
But finding themselves hard
pressed they split their band,
two going one way and five another.
Yan kept with him one,
Duff, and leaving the others to follow the
five deer, he took up the twofold trail.
Why? Because in it was the great broad
track he had followed for two years back.
</p>

<p>
On they went, overtaking the deer and
causing them to again split. Yan sent
Duff after the doe while he stuck relentlessly
to the track of the famous Stag.
As the sun got low, the chase led to a great
half-wooded stretch, in a country new to
him; for he had driven the Stag far from
his ancient range. The trail again grew
hot, but just as Yan felt sure he soon
would close, two distant shots were heard
and the track of the Stag as he found it
then went off in a fear-winged flight that
might keep on for miles.
</p>

<p>
Yan went at a run and soon found Duff.
He had had two long shots at the doe.

The second he thought had
hit her. Within half a mile
they found blood on the trail;
within another half mile the
blood was no more seen and
the track seemed to have
grown very large and strong. The snow
was drifting and the marks not easily
read, yet Yan knew very soon that the
track they were on was not that of the
wounded doe, but was surely that of her
antlered mate. Back on the trail they
ran till they solved the doubt, for there
they learned that the Stag, after making
his own escape, had come back to change
off; an old, old trick of the hunted whereby
one deer will cleverly join on and carry
on the line of tracks to save another that
is too hard pressed, while it leaps aside to
hide or fly in a different direction. Thus
the Stag had sought to save his wounded
mate, but the hunters remorselessly took
up her trail and gloated like wolves over
the slight drip of blood. Within another
short run they found that the Stag, having
failed to divert the chase to himself, had
returned to her, and at sundown they
sighted them a quarter of a mile ahead
mounting a long snow slope. The doe
was walking slowly with hanging head
and ears. The Buck was running about
as though in trouble that he did not understand,
and coming back to caress the
doe and wonder why she walked so slowly.
In another half mile the hunters came
up with them. She was down in the snow.
When he saw them coming, the great Stag
shook the oak-tree on his brow and circled
about in doubt, then fled from a foe he
was powerless to resist.
</p>

<p>
As the men came near, the doe made
a convulsive effort to rise, but could not.
Duff drew his knife. It never before occurred
to Yan why he and each of them carried
a long knife. The poor doe turned
on her foes her great lustrous eyes; they
were brimming with tears, but she made
no moan. Yan turned his back on the
scene and covered his face with his hands,
but Duff went forward with the knife and
did some dreadful, unspeakable thing, Yan
scarcely knew what, and when Duff called
him he slowly turned, and the big Stag's
mate was lying quiet in the snow, and the
only living thing that they saw as they quit
the scene was the great round form bearing
aloft the oak-tree on its brow as it
haunted the nearer hills.
</p>

<p>
And when, an hour later, the men came
with the sleigh to lift the doe's body from
the crimsoned snow, there were large fresh
tracks about it, and a dark shadow passed
over the whitened hill into the silent night.
</p>

<p class="p2">
What morbid thoughts came from the
fire that night. How the man in Yan did
taunt the glutted brute. Was this the end?
Was this the real chase? After long weeks,
with the ideal alone in mind, after countless
blessed failures, was this the vile success
a beautiful, glorious, living creature
tortured into a loathsome mass of carrion?
</p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
But when the morning came the impress
of the night was dim. A long howl
came over the hill, and the thought that a
wolf was on the trail that he was quitting
smote sadly on Yan's heart. They all set
out for the settlement, but within an hour
Yan only wanted an excuse to stay. And
when at length they ran onto the fresh
track of the Sandhill Stag himself, the lad
was all ablaze once more.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot go back&mdash;something tells
me that I must stay&mdash;I must see him face
to face again."
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-074b.jpg" width="42" height="145" alt="Knife" />
</div>

<p>
The rest had had enough of the bitter
frost, so Yan took from the sleigh a small
pot, a blanket, and some food, and left
them, to follow alone the great sharp imprint
in the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by&mdash;good luck."
</p>

<p>
He watched the sleigh out of sight, in
the low hills, and then felt as he never had
before. Though he had been so many
months alone in the wilds he had never
known loneliness, but as soon as his friends
were gone he was overwhelmed by a sense
of the utter heart-sickening dreariness of
the endless, snowy waste. Where were the
charms that he had never failed to find
until now? He wanted to recall the sleigh,
but pride kept him silent.
</p>

<p>
In a little while it was too late, and soon
he was once more in the power of that
fascinating endless chain of tracks. A
chain begun years ago, when in a June
the track of a mother blacktail was suddenly
joined by two little ones' tracks;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
since then the three had gone on winding
over the land, the trail-chains they
were forging. Knotted and kinked, and
twisted with every move and thought of
the makers, imprinted with every hap of
their lives, but interrupted never wholly.
At times the tracks were joined by that
of some fierce foe, and the kind of mark
was changed, but the chains went on for
months or years, now fast, now slow, but
endless, until some foe more strong joined
on and there one trail was ended. But
this great Stag was forging still that mystic
chain. A million roods of hills had he
overlaid with its links and scribbled over
in this oldest script with the story
of his life. If only our eyes were
bright enough to follow up that
twenty thousand miles of trail,
what light unguessed we might obtain
on the wild things' lives and
thoughts.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-075.jpg" width="71" height="119" alt="Wolf" />
</div>

<p>
But skin deep, man is brute.
Just a little while ago we were
mere hunting-brutes&mdash;our bellies
were our only thought, that telltale
line of dots was the road to food.
No man can follow it far without feeling
a wild beast prickling in his hair and down
his spine. Away Yan went, a hunter-brute
once more, all other feelings swamped.
</p>

<p>
Late that day the trail, after many a
kink and seeming break, led into a great
dense thicket of brittle, quaking asp. Yan
knew that the Stag was there to lie and
rest. The deer went in up-wind, of
course. His eyes and ears would watch
his trail, and his nose would guard in
front, so Yan went in at one side, trusting
to get a shot. With a very agony of care
he made his way, step by step, and, after
many minutes, surely found the track, still
leading on. Another lengthy crawl, with
nerves at tense, and then the lad thought
he heard a twig snapped behind him,
though the track was still ahead. And
after long he found it true. Before lying
down the Stag had doubled back, and
while Yan had thought him still ahead, he
was lying far behind, so had gotten wind
of the man and now was miles away.
</p>

<p>
Once more into the unknown north
away, till cold, black night came down;
then Yan sought out a sheltered spot and
made a tiny, red man's fire. As Chaska had
taught him long ago&mdash;"Big fire for fool."
</p>

<p>
When the lad curled up to sleep he felt
a vague wish to turn three times like a
dog, and a well-defined wish that he had
fur on his face and a bushy tail to lay
around his freezing hands and feet, for it
was a night of northern frost. Old Peboan
was stalking on the snow. The stars
seemed to crackle, so one could almost
hear. The trees and earth were bursting
with the awful frost. The ice on a near
lake was rent all night by cracks that went
whooping from shore to shore; and down
between the hills there poured the cold
that burns.
</p>

<p>
A prairie-wolf came by in the night, but
he did not howl or treat Yan like
an outsider now. He gave a gentle,
doglike "<i>Woof, woof</i>," a sort of
"Oho! so you have come to it at
last," and passed away. Toward
morning the weather grew milder,
but with the change there came a
driving snow. The track was blotted
out. Yan had heeded nothing
else and did not know where he
was. After travelling an aimless
mile or two he decided to make for Pine
Creek, which ought to lie southeastward.
But which way was southeast?
The powdery snow was driven along
through the air, blinding, stinging, burning.
On all things near it was like smoke,
and on farther things, a driving fog. But
he made for a quaking asp grove, and
there, sticking through the snow, he found
a crozier golden-rod, dead and dry, but
still faithfully delivering its message, "Yon
is the north." With course corrected, on
he went, and, whenever in doubt, dug out
this compass-flower, till the country dipped
and Pine Creek lay below.
</p>

<p>
There was good camping here, the very
spot indeed where, fifteen years before,
Butler had camped on his Loneland Journey;
but now the blizzard had ceased, so
Yan spent the day hunting without seeing
a track, and he spent the night as before,
wishing that nature had been kinder to
him in the matter of fur. During that first
lone night his face and toes had been
frozen and now bore burning sores. But
still he kept on the chase, for a something
within had told him that the Grail was
surely near. Next day a strange, unreasoning
guess sent him east across the creek
in a deerless-looking barren land. Within
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
half a mile he came on dim tracks
made lately in the storm. He followed,
and soon found where six deer
had lain at rest, and among them a
great, broad bed and a giant track
that only one could have made.
The track was almost fresh, the sign
unfrozen still. "Within a mile," he
thought. But within a hundred yards
there loomed up on a fog-wrapped hillside
five heads with ears regardant, and at that
moment, too, there rose up from the snowy
top a great form like a blasted trunk with
two dead boughs still on. But they had
seen him first, and before the deadly gun
could play, six beacons waved and a
friendly hill had screened them from its
power.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-076a.jpg" width="52" height="107" alt="Plant" />
</div>

<p>
The Sandhill Stag had gathered his
brood again, yet now that the murderer
was on the track once more, he scattered
them as before. But there was only one
track for Yan.
</p>

<p>
At last the chase led away to the great
dip of Pine Creek. A mile-wide flat, with
a long dense thicket down the middle.
</p>

<p>
"There is where he is hiding and
watching now, but there he will not rest,"
said something within, and Yan kept out
of sight and watched; after half an hour
a dark spot left the willow belt and wandered
up the farther hill. When he was
well out of sight over the hill Yan ran
across the valley and stalked around to get
the trail on the down-wind side. He found
it, and there learned that the Stag was
as wise as he&mdash;he had climbed a good
lookout and watched his back trail, then
seeing Yan crossing the flat, his track
went swiftly bounding, bounding&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Stag knew just how things stood;
a single match to a finish now, and he led
away for a new region. But Yan was learning
something he had often heard, that
the swiftest deer can be run down by a
hardy man; for he was as fresh as ever,
but the great Stag's bounds were shortening,
he was surely tiring out, he must
throw off the
hunter now, or
he is lost.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-076b.jpg" width="82" height="152" alt="Dancer" />
</div>

<p>
He often
mounted a high
hill to scan the
white world for
his foe, and the
after-trail was a record of what he learned
or feared. At last his trail came to a sudden
end. This was a mystery until long study
showed how he had returned backward
on his own track for a hundred yards
then bounded aside to fly in another direction.
Three times he did this and then
passed through an aspen thicket and, returning,
lay down in this thicket near his
own track so that in following, Yan must
pass where the Stag could smell and hear
him long before the trail brought the hunter
over close.
</p>

<p>
All these doublings and many more
like them were patiently unravelled, and
the shortening bounds were straightened
out once more till, as daylight waned, the
tracks seemed to grow stale and the bounds
again grow long. After a little, Yan became
wholly puzzled, so he stopped right
there and spent another wretched night.
Next day at dawn he worked it out.
</p>

<p>
He found he had been running the trail
he had already run. With a long hark
back, the doubt was cleared. The desperate
Stag had joined onto his old track
and bounded aside at length to let the
hunter follow the cold scent. But the
join-on was found and the real trail
read, and the tale that it told was of
a great Stag wearing out, too tired to
eat, too scared to sleep, and a tireless
hunter after.
</p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
A last long follow brought the hunt
back to familiar ground&mdash;a marsh-encompassed
tract of woods with three
ways in. There was the deer's trail entering.
Yan felt he would not come out
there, for he knew his foe was following.
So swiftly and silently the hunter made for
the second road on the down-wind side,
and having hung his coat and sash there
on a swaying sapling, he hastened to the
third way out, and hid. After awhile, seeing
nothing,
Yan gave the
low call that the
jaybird gives
when there's
danger abroad
in the woods.
</p>

<p>
All deer take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
guidance from the jay, and away off in
the encompassed woods Yan saw the
great Stag with wavering ears go up a
high lookout. A low whistle turned him
to a statue, but he was far away with many
a twig between. For some seconds he
stood sniffing the wind and gazing with
his back to his foe, watching the back
trail, where so long his enemy had been,
but never dreaming of that enemy in ambush
ahead. Then the breeze set the coat
on the sapling afluttering. The Stag
quickly quit the hillock, not leaping or
crashing through the brush&mdash;he had years
ago got past that&mdash;but, silent and weasel-like,
threading the maze he disappeared.
Yan crouched in the willow thicket and
strained his every sense and tried to train
his ears to watch the harder. A twig ticked
in the copse he was in. Yan slowly rose
with nerve and sense at tightest tense, the
gun in line&mdash;and as he rose, then also rose,
but fifteen feet away, a wondrous pair of
bronze and ivory horns, a royal head, a
noble form behind it, and face to face
they stood, Yan and the Sandhill Stag.
At last&mdash;at last, his life was in Yan's
hands. The Stag flinched not but stood
and gazed with those great ears and
mournful, truthful eyes, and the rifle
leaped but sank again, for the Stag stood
still and calmly looked him in the eyes,
and Yan felt the prickling fading from his
scalp, his clenched teeth eased, his limbs,
bent as to spring, relaxed and manlike
stood erect.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, shoot, shoot now! This is
what you have toiled for," said a faint and
fading voice, and spoke no more.
</p>

<p>
Yan remembered that night when he,
himself, run down, had turned to face the
hunting wolves. He remembered that
night when the snow was red with crime
and down between them now he dimly
saw a vision of an agonized and dying
doe, with great, sad eyes, that only asked,
"What harm have I done you?" A
change came over him and every thought
of murder went from Yan as they gazed
into each other's eyes&mdash;and hearts. For
different thoughts and a wholly different
concept of the Stag, coming&mdash;coming&mdash;had
come.
</p>

<p class="p2">
"Oh, beautiful creature! One of our
wise men has said, the body is the soul made
visible; is your spirit then so beautiful&mdash;as
beautiful as wise? We have long stood as
foes, hunter and hunted, but now that is
changed and we stand face to face, fellow-creatures
looking in each other's eyes, not
knowing each other's speech&mdash;but knowing
motives and feelings. Now I understand
you as I never did before; surely
you at least in part understand me. For
your life is at last in my power, yet you
have no fear. I knew of a deer once,
that, run down by the hounds, sought
safety with the hunter, and he saved it&mdash;and
you also I have run down and you
boldly seek safety with me. Yes! you are
as wise as you are beautiful. We are
brothers, oh, bounding Blacktail! only
I am the elder and stronger, and if only
my strength could always be at hand to save
you, you would never come to harm. Go
now without fear, to range the piney hills;
never more shall I follow your trail with
the wild wolf rampant in my heart. Less
and less as I grow do I see in your race
mere flying marks, or butcher-meat. We
have grown, little brother, and learned
many things that you know not, but you
have many a precious sense that is wholly
hidden from us. Go now without fear
of me.
</p>

<p>
"I may never see you again. But if you
only would come sometimes and look me
in the eyes and make me feel as you have
done to-day, you would drive the wild
beast wholly from my heart and then the
veil would be a little drawn and I should
know more of the things that wise men
have prayed to know. And yet I feel&mdash;it
never will be&mdash;I have found the Grail. I
have learned what Buddha learned. I
shall never see you again. Farewell."

JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGEMENT
<br />

<p>
While it is generally
recognized that flower
arrangement affords an
excellent opportunity for
the display of good taste
and artistic judgment, we
by no means consider it,
as in Japan, an art distinct
in itself.
</p>

<p>
In Japan the art of flower
arrangement is as highly
regarded as music, poetry,
or painting; and in order
that one may become expert
therein, it is deemed
necessary to devote quite
as much attention, time, and study to this
as to any other form of art. We look
upon flower arrangement in general as
merely the result of individual taste, but a
Japanese regards it from a very different
point of view. He is governed, in this accomplishment,
by numerous and well-defined
rules which can only be acquired by
long and patient study. It would be impossible,
without this knowledge, to compose
an arrangement of flowers which would
meet with the approval of competent critics.
It would, in fact, be quite as hopeless as for
a musician to compose great masterpieces
of music without previous training and careful
study. The art of flower arrangement is
not only practised by women and girls, but
by men as well, for it is an accomplishment
indispensable for all who would make any
pretence to learning and culture.
</p>

<p>
During a conversation between a Japanese
friend and myself, I once remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
that a certain young
lady was not very pretty.
"You are quite
right," he answered,
"but she is very clever
at flower arrangement."
</p>

<p class="caption">Arrangement of Bamboo,<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>
There are six or seven
schools of flower arrangement,
and while
they differ more or less
as to details, the fundamental
principles are
alike in all.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the fact
that flowers are so inseparably
associated
with everything Japanese,
it would be a mistake to assume that
Japan is a land of flowers for wild, as well
as garden flowers, are far more profuse in
many sections of this country. Japan is,
however, rich in cultivated flowers that are
grown in great profusion in garden and
nursery in the suburbs of all the cities.
</p>

<p>
Flower sellers, carrying their fragrant
burdens in huge baskets, are met with
everywhere, and they are patronized by
the poor as well as by the rich, for the
prices are low enough to bring them within
the reach of all. Although there are
many varieties of flowers, few, comparatively,
are used in flower arrangement for
the Japanese limit their choice to those with
which they are most familiar and such as
are most closely associated with the different
months or seasons, seldom or never
using rare or unknown flowers.
</p>

<p>
The reason given for this is that a thorough
knowledge of the character of the
flowers and the conditions under which
they grow is indispensable, in order that
a proper and effective use of them may
be made.
</p>

<p>
The following may be mentioned as the
popular flowers of Japan, and most closely
associated by the Japanese with the different
seasons of the year:
</p>

<p>
The first to appear is the plum blossom,
which is hailed with delight as the harbinger
of spring, and enjoys, therefore,
the greatest popularity.
</p>

<p>
The plum is closely followed by the
cherry blossom, which almost rivals the
former as a favorite.
</p>

<p>
The next, and the last of the spring
flowers, is the Wistaria. Summer's flowers
include the peony, iris, and the lotus;
while autumn claims one of the chief favorites,
the chrysanthemum, and also the
morning-glory.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Corner of Iris Garden.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Winter has no flowers, but here the
poetic imagination of the Japanese fills
the void; for when trees and landscape are
whitened with snow, he converts this, in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
picturesque fancy, into "winter flowers,"
and this exquisite love and appreciation of
all that nature affords in her various
phases, is a strongly developed trait, common
to all classes of Japan.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-080.jpg" width="396" height="510" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Lotus Flowers at Kamakura.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Certain flowers are considered lucky and
others unlucky&mdash;the latter including all
such as are supposed to possess poisonous
qualities. I found, for instance, that one
of the wild flowers, a beautiful scarlet lily,
known as the Shibuta-no-hanna, which I
greatly admired, was regarded with disfavor
and was never used for decoration
or flower arrangements, for the reason
that it was a flower of ill omen.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a favorite arrangement,
formed of a combination of pine,
bamboo, and plum blossoms, is symbolic
of good luck and everlasting happiness. It
is frequently used on festive occasions and
figures conspicuously in the New Year's
decorations that are arranged over gate
and doorway.
</p>

<p>
The first glimpse that
I obtained of a flower
arrangement scene in
Japan was presented to
me under conditions that
made a most pleasing
and lasting impression.

<p>
The little daughter of
one of my neighbors in
Tokio, who gloried in the
name of Kosakurasan,
little Miss Cherryblossom,
had kindly consented
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
to pose for a picture upon which I was
engaged. During the several sittings that
I received from this little lady of eight she
told me much of her short but eventful
life. She attended school, and explained
that aside from the regular instructions she
received, her parents had engaged a very
accomplished young lady to give her sisters
and herself a lesson in flower arrangement
once a week at home.

A few days later little Miss Cherry-blossom
appeared at my studio-door with a
large bunch of chrysanthemums in her arms
and an invitation from her mother to be
present at a lesson which
the teacher was about to
give. I accompanied my
little friend, and arriving
at her home, was ushered
into a room where I
found the teacher and
pupils deeply absorbed
in their interesting study.
I watched the proceedings
with great interest,
and though I failed to
comprehend much of
what the teacher endeavored to impart
to her pupils, it gave me great pleasure
to observe the interesting group. These
bright-eyed, prettily dressed little Japanese
maidens, earnestly engaged in their interesting
occupation and surrounded by
quantities of flowers, formed such a charming
and delightful scene, that I decided on
the spot to make it the subject for a picture.
</p>

<p>
Later on I carried out this idea, and the
illustration which appears on <a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a>, gives
an impression of the result. I engaged a
famous old professor to arrange the chrysanthemums
as they appear in the picture.
The old man came to my studio bringing
the flowers which he had carefully selected,
and spent over an hour in making the
arrangement. Several times, when it was
almost completed, he pulled it to pieces
and began again, exclaiming that it was
not good enough. "It would pass," he
said, "for ordinary purposes;" but since
it was to serve as a model to be copied
into the picture, nothing but absolute perfection
would satisfy him.
</p>

<p>
This old professor was famous in his art
and enjoyed great distinction and consideration&mdash;as
much so as any famous poet
or painter.
</p>

<p>
Aside from his occupation as a teacher,
he was frequently engaged by wealthy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
people and by proprietors of tea-houses to
make arrangements of flowers for dinner-parties
and other festive occasions. Many
methods are known and employed for
keeping cut flowers fresh; and some of
the famous professors of this art claim to
possess the secret of certain ingredients,
which, added to the water containing the
flowers, have a stimulating effect and
greatly prolong their life. The successful
application of this process, known as mizuage,
requires much experience, certain
plants requiring a strong and others a
weak solution.
</p>

</div>

<p>
One enthusiastic exponent of this art declared
to me that many years ago, at a
flower arrangement competition, given by
a famous Daimio, he had received the
first prize for an arrangement of bamboo,
which, to the surprise of everyone, remained
fresh and unfaded for twenty-seven
days. This had been accomplished&mdash;without
the use of water&mdash;by injecting
a certain tonic into an opening which he
had bored at the top of the bamboo
stalk.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, when he had arranged
a combination of bamboo and
morning-glory, he had carefully wrapped
strips of paper around each of the flowers
early in the morning before they had
opened. Later in the afternoon, and just
before this flower arrangement was to be
shown to a company of guests, he had removed
these paper wraps, and, by pouring
a certain liquid into the water, had caused
the flowers slowly to unfold before the eyes
of the delighted spectators.
</p>

<p>
Entertainments of this character, where
guests are invited to view various arrangements
of flowers made especially for
the occasion, are often given. Sometimes
a guest is invited to make an extemporary
arrangement, the flowers and
everything necessary being provided for
the purpose.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, on a visit to the girls'
high school in Kioto, I found a class of
twenty or thirty girls receiving a lesson in
flower arrangement. The professor, an old
and distinguished-looking man, was seated
before a low stand with a heap of flowers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
and shrubs at his side, and as Japanese
houses are not provided with tables and
chairs, the pupils and master were seated
on the matted floor.
</p>

<p>
The teacher selected a few sprays from
the heap and after carefully trimming off
the decayed leaves and twigs, proceeded
to arrange the blossoms in a vase standing
before him. The lines given to the
branches and stems of flowers were not
always natural, but the character was given
by much twisting and bending, as well
as in the manner in which they were fastened
in the vase; the stems of the flowers
being held firmly in place by two short
sticks of wood, wedged in tightly across
the neck of the vase. In some instances a
forked twig serves the
same purpose. The
chief feature of Japanese
flower arrangement
is simplicity, and
usually but few flowers
are required. The object
of this device,
therefore, is to give to
the stems a firm position
and enable them
to rise erect out of the
centre of the vase.
Sometimes small metal crabs, or tortoises,
are utilized as wedges.

<p class="caption">Kohenai, Iris and Chrysanthemum<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>
As the professor arranged the flowers, he
carefully explained his method to a group
of five or six girls who were seated opposite
to him. He impressed upon them
the fact that flower arrangements are linear
in character: being, in most instances,
based on three lines rising gracefully from
the neck of the vase. The centre or principal
line should be the longest, the second
one-half, and the third one-fourth the length
of the first. He cautioned them against
allowing these three stem-lines to cross one
another in a way to form angles, nor should
they be permitted to run in parallel lines.
Other arrangements are based on five and
seven lines and sometimes as many as nine
or eleven, but these are uncommon and
are rarely seen.
</p>

<p>
During the lesson the professor imparted
much instructive information to his pupils.
Among other things he told them that in
the art of flower arrangement the student
must be guided by nature and a careful
study and observation of the character and
habits of the flowers employed. Everything
unnatural and inappropriate must be
strictly avoided. Flowers of different seasons
should never be arranged together,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
and no flower, however beautiful, should
have a place in such arrangement out of
its proper season.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-084.jpg" width="423" height="331" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Lesson in Flower Arrangement.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Symmetry in flower arrangement should
be avoided, and under no circumstances
should both sides of a composition correspond
or match. (This principle, it may
be said, is observed in all forms of Japanese
art.) It would be in very bad taste, for
instance, to allow two vines to hang symmetrically
from either side of a suspended
vase, or even for a flower of one color to
be placed between two of another color.
</p>

<p>
One of the fundamental rules of this art
is that all flower arrangements should fit
into a triangle, either vertical or horizontal,
and that in itself serves more or less as
a restriction against symmetrical compositions.
Great attention should be given
also to the manner in which the stems rise
out of the water, as they should present a
strong and vigorous appearance, and hold,
in fact, the same relation to the flowers that
the trunk of a tree bears to the branches
and foliage overhead. Plants that grow
erect should be given an upright direction
in floral arrangements, while such, for instance,
as grow overhanging the banks of
streams or cliffs should be arranged in a
hanging position. The professor demonstrated
all this with numerous examples
which he made and then distributed to
the pupils.
</p>

<p>
Each girl, upon receiving a finished example,
made a low bow to the master;
and retiring to the other end of the room,
proceeded to take the
flowers apart and rearrange
them as before.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
After having accomplished
this to the best
of her ability, she returned
with it to the
teacher's desk, when
he pointed out to her
any defects it might
contain.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese divide
plants and flowers,
without any regard
to scientific facts, into the male and female
sex. Trees, mountains, and streams
are likewise classified as their fancy wills.
This division of flowers and plants into
sexes forms an important consideration in
the art of flower arrangement. In a composition
in which delicate plants and slender
vines are used in connection with stems of
trees, the latter represent the male element
and should always form the centre or backbone
of the arrangement and serve as a
support for the former, the female element.

<p class="caption">Morning-Glory and Shion<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>
The various vessels used
for holding the flowers form
a very important feature in
the art of flower arrangement,
and a great many varieties
are utilized for this
purpose. Certain arrangements
require long-necked
vessels of earthenware or
bronze, while broad and
shallow ones are used for
others. A great variety of
baskets, known as flower
baskets, are also used.
These vary in shape and
size, and some are suspended, while others
are placed upon the ground. They always
contain an inner vessel for holding water.
</p>

<p>
Another form of vessel very extensively
used is one made of a cylinder of bamboo.
This is generally formed from a section
cut near the root, where the form is irregular
and the joints are close together.
These bamboo tubes are from one to two
feet in height and from three to six inches
in diameter, and sometimes have holes cut
in the sides for inserting flowers.
</p>

<p>
Bamboo vases in the forms of boats are
often hung in Japanese rooms. Imitation
well-buckets, made of lacquered wood or
porcelain, are also employed for holding
flowers. Always used in pairs, they are
generally suspended over a pulley by a silk
rope, and make a very effective and pleasing
decoration for a room.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important results of the
study of this floral art has been in the direction
of simplicity. It has created a love
and an appreciation for the beauty of a
single flower&mdash;for in its color and form, in
its graceful stem and well-formed leaves,
the votaries of this art find far more enjoyment
than in confused masses of many
colored flowers.
</p>

<p>
While there is, no doubt, much in Japanese
flower arrangement that is unintelligible
to us and would fail to appeal to the
uninitiated, there is also much that would
be understood and admired everywhere
by persons of good taste. It is indeed a
wonder that our attention has not been
more generally drawn to this interesting
study, so suggestive of a new and promising
field of artistic possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Flower arrangement in Japan, like music,
painting, and architecture, is in harmony
with the peculiar and unique civilization
of that country, and could not,
therefore, be taken literally and grafted on
to a civilization so radically different as our
own. The principle, however, might be
adopted and developed on lines in harmony
with our arts and to the enrichment
of our civilization. As an art it is full of
possibilities, and would not only bring us
into closer communion, and into a better
understanding with nature and the floral
world, but would also exercise a most
æsthetic influence and add an unknown
charm to our daily lives.

The impression made by
Webster's personality, referred
to at the beginning
of these papers, partly accounts
for the eagerness
with which everything he
said or did is caught up, even at second
hand. In any gathering, however brilliant,
the whole company pricks up its ears and
listens if one of them says, "I shook hands
with Daniel Webster," or "I once heard
him speak," or "I saw him go by in the
street." So it seems well worth while to include
among these very important and
characteristic papers of Mr. Webster, now
published for the first time, not only several
of his letters, but a few notes that might
seem trifling and insignificant if they related
to anybody else.
</p>

<p>
The following letters written from London
show Mr. Webster's opinion of the
English lawyers and public speakers, and
his keen interest in everything relating to
agriculture. The alarm which was excited
by the fear of a dishonor of the drafts of
the Bank of the United States is an interesting
fact in our financial history:

</p>
<p>
"On Monday morning, the 2nd inst, we
arrived at Lpool, after a passage of 14½
days, or rather less, from Pilot to Pilot.
For a great part of the way we had calm,
the rest, light winds ahead; which same
light winds have so retarded the sailing
ships, that we were in Lpool several days
before the N. Y. Packet of May 1., tho'
we left the 18th. We staid in Lpool 2
days, went to Chester, and thence struck
off &amp; hit the Lpool &amp; London Rail Road,
&amp; got to London, on the evening of the
5th. The sixth, it was rainy. I went out,
quite alone, looked into all the Courts&mdash;the
whole four were sitting&mdash;I saw all their
venerable wigs. I stayed long enough to
hear several Gentlemen speak. They are
vastly better <i>trained</i> than we are. They
speak short. They get up, begin immediately,
&amp; leave off when they have
done. Their manner is more like that of
a school boy, who gets up to say his lesson,
goes right through it, &amp; then sits down,
than it is like our more leisurely &amp; elaborate
habit. I think Sergeant Wilde, who is
esteemed a long speaker, argued an insurance
question in 15 minutes, that most
of us would have got an hour's speech out
of. The rooms are all small, with very inconvenient
writing places, &amp; almost nobody
present, except the wigged population.
I went to the Parliament Houses
(Houses not in session). They are very
small rooms. Where the Lords sit, I was
sure, must be the old painted chamber
where the Comees. of conference used to
meet. On entering it, I asked the guide,
<i>what Comee. room that was</i>&mdash;he turned to
rebuke my ignorance, &amp; exclaimed, "this
is the House of Lords." I was right, however.
The H. of C. was burnt, you know,
some time ago, &amp; the H. of C. now sit in
what was the H. of L., &amp; the Lords sit,
temporarily, in the old painted chamber.
All these accommodations are small &amp;
paltry; &amp; new buildings are in progress for
the use of both Houses.
</p>

"The political state of things is quite
unsettled. All sorts of expectations exist,
as to what shall happen. The ministry,
most certainly, are very weak, in public
estimation, &amp; as clearly not very strong
in their own. But Lord Wellington, whose
weight &amp; influence are, at this moment,
prodigious, does not want office; &amp; it is
said that both he &amp; Sir Robt. see the difficulty
which they would be obliged to
encounter, if in power, in consequence of

the state of things in Ireland. Mr. O'Connell
is king of Ireland; &amp; it is thought
that nothing but military power could keep
the peace in that kingdom of his under an
administration which he should oppose.
Some speak of a dissolution of Parliament&mdash;others
say, the Queen will rather give
way to radicalism, than receive the tories
into power. A new election, in the opinion
of some, would give the Tories a working
majority of 70 members. On all
these topics, I have seen too little, &amp; know
too little, to be able to form any opinion
for myself. As yet, I have not attended
any Debates in Parliament, but purpose
to go to the H. C. to-morrow Evening to
witness a second Debate on the Jamaica
Question. As to private matters, I will
write you, if possible, in season for the
same conveyance which takes this,&mdash;if
not, I will write by the next. I propose to
send this by the Lpool, which sails on the
13th.

"I have recd. your letter, respecting
the two acceptances. I had thought they
were both provided for. As the Boat goes
to-morrow, and as I returned to London
only last evening, I may not be able to
arrange so as to write by this opportunity;
but by the <i>very next</i>, I will cause you to
hear from me. We have been about six
weeks, having run over much of England,
&amp; something of Scotland. Of course we
could stay but little time in any one place,
nor were we able to see much below the
surface of things. But the agriculture,
and the general of things, in England &amp;
Scotland, I have looked at, pretty attentively.
Taken together, England exhibits
a high wrought, exact, elaborate system
of art &amp; industry. Every productive
power is carried to the utmost extent of
skill, &amp; maintained in the most unceasing
activity. Constant attention &amp; close calculation
pervade everything. Rent is high,
but prices of produce are high also. About
thirty shillings, Sterling, say seven dollars,
or thereabouts, may be regarded, perhaps,
as near the average rent of good land in
England. In some parts, it is much higher,
say ten dollars, or, rent &amp; tithes together,
perhaps fifteen. The land is vastly productive,
&amp; prices are high. A gentleman
told me yesterday that he had sold, some
weeks ago, his wheat crop, at eleven
pounds Sterling, pr acre, standing, &amp; his
oat crop for eight. This will shew you
the aggregate of product &amp; price. Forty
bushels of wheat, &amp; fifty or even sixty of
oats, are not an uncommon yield to the
acre. The land is naturally good, &amp; is
made the subject of the most careful &amp; skilful
cultivation. In the course of forty years,
the <i>turnip</i> has vastly enriched England.
It feeds millions of sheep, whose wool &amp;
flesh command high prices, &amp; the feeding
of which in the field, during the winter, say
ten sheep to the acre, enriches the land,
for the succeeding crop of wheat. Then,
too, lime is used extensively, &amp; every bone
ground up, for bone dust, which is found
a most powerful manure. And when the
lands require it, a complete system of underground
draining is practised, especially
in Scotland, which produces the best
effects. Agricultural labor is not more
than half as dear in England, as in the
U. S.

"(I shall add a P.S. if I learn anything
before this P. M. of this matter of the U.
S. Bank &amp; Hottinguer.

Bills of the Bk. U. S. for the honor of the

agt. in U. S. of which his principals
were not seasonably advised. It is
an unlucky affair, at least, &amp; will much
prejudice American interests and credits
here."

any other man the author of Revolutionary
measures; to John Adams as the colossus
of the great debate of liberty which
preceded the Declaration of Independence;
Mr. Jay's authorship of the Address

the four greatest state papers in our history;
of the fact that Richard Henry Lee
came near being a stamp-master, and the
fact that Virginia and the New England
States always acted together and carried
through the Revolution, picking up a few
other votes where they could:

Next comes a letter from Lord Ashburton,
written from London, June 18, 1852,
interesting for the confession of that sincere
and candid Englishman, that he did
not pretend to be a free-trader for America.
If many of our English advisers, and many
Americans who have been prone to take
their advice, had been as sensible as Lord
Ashburton, it would have been much better
for all concerned. This letter, as some
others of Ashburton's which have been
published heretofore, is a thorough refutation,
if any were needed after Edward Everett's
conclusive statement, of the old
slander once uttered in Parliament, and
occasionally revived on both sides of the
Atlantic, that Mr. Webster obtained dishonest
advantage over the English Commissioner
by suppressing an ancient map
wherein the boundary between Maine and
Nova Scotia had been traced in conformity
with the British claim. Lord Ashburton's
expressions of friendship and esteem
for Mr. Webster are wholly inconsistent
with such a transaction:

The following letter, addressed to Mr.
Webster's law partner, John P. Healey,
with its enclosure, has never been printed.
Allusions are found to it in other letters of
Mr. Webster written from London, contained
in Mr. Webster's published correspondence.
It is probable that Mr. Webster's
friends in Boston took the liberty of
withholding his letter refusing to be a candidate.
At any rate, his name was presented
to the Whig National Convention
held at Harrisburg in October(?), 1839.
That convention was held more than a
year before the election. The delegates
from each State were requested to present
to the convention the name of their own
choice for the Presidency, and with it the
name of the other person whom they
thought likely to be the strongest candidate
in case their own selection were not
adopted by the convention. These reports
of the different delegations were all
referred to a grand committee with instructions
to recommend a candidate to the
convention. The result was the nomination
of General Harrison by a large majority.
Then a committee was appointed
to select a candidate for the Vice-Presidency.
That committee first agreed
upon the name of Benjamin Watkins
Leigh, but, on his refusal to be a candidate,
reported the name of John Tyler,
with most unfortunate results for the Whig
party:

As it has been expected that a Convention

much earlier than the period fixed for

which, if I were at home, might demand

maintain, unimpaired, the Constitution of
the Country, and to uphold all its great

Mr. Webster was counsel in the celebrated
case of Myra Clark Gaines, the
wife of General Gaines, who laid claim to
a large property in Louisiana as the
daughter of Daniel Clark by an alleged
marriage with Zuleima Carriere. This
marriage was denied, and it was also alleged
that the mother of Mrs. Gaines had,
at the time of the alleged marriage, another
lawful husband living.

Mr. Webster's brief, which is in his
own writing, consists of seventeen pages
of manuscript notes. It contains nothing
specially striking except an observation
about one of the witnesses, a woman who
seems to have been called to prove a marriage
of reputation, and seems to have
been one of three female witnesses called
by the same party. Mr. Webster's memorandum
for his arguments is this:
</p>

<p>
"There is but one witness. And who is
she? Who are they all? Not respectable
women at that period. All three alike.

This letter to William Sullivan refers to

Webster for her inspection, as appears by
the following note written by Sullivan in

The following letter to Mr. Brewer is
interesting as showing Mr. Webster's interest
in questions relating to the currency.
It is well known that he himself thought
that the department of activity in which he
was most capable to render service to the
country was that of finance, and that he
would have liked very well to have taken
the Treasury instead of the Department of
State in Harrison's administration:

proceeded so far, as to justify the expectation
that the Country is now ready to renounce,
entirely, the folly of "Experiments"
on the currency, &amp; to return to
the former well approved system of finance
&amp; currency, may admit of doubt. To the
friends of the right cause, however, there
remains nothing but a steady, honest, patriotic

Some very zealous persons were impatient
of Mr. Webster's hesitation and irresolution
long before the time of the
anti-slavery struggle. My Uncle Jeremiah
Evarts, a man whom many people think
quite the intellectual equal of his son, the
famous advocate, threw himself with all
his zeal into the defence of the Cherokee
Indians when they were removed from
their homes in Georgia by the Legislature
of that State, in spite of the judgment of
the Supreme Court, which was set at defiance.
Mr. Evarts said, "There is One
who knows how to execute His judgments."
That prophecy had a terrible
fulfilment in the region about Missionary
Ridge, named, I suppose, for the mission
to those Indians maintained by the board
of which Mr. Evarts was secretary, which
during the Civil War was, as Horace
Maynard told me, drenched with blood
and honeycombed with graves. Mr.
Evarts gave his life to the cause of these
oppressed people. His death was caused
by over-exertion in their defence. He always
claimed to have Mr. Webster's
promise of earnest support; and whether
he were right or not, no such promise was
ever kept. But I have in my possession
a considerable number of bound volumes
of pamphlets which belonged to Mr. Webster,
including many presentation copies
from their authors who were among his
famous cotemporaries. One of them is
a copy of Jeremiah Evarts's "William
Penn," written by him in the cause of the
Cherokee Indians, which was very famous
in its day. On the title-page,
written in pencil but still quite legible, in
Daniel Webster's handwriting, are the
words: "When Greece uttered her voice
and stretched forth her hand for aid your
hearts were moved, your kindling sympathies
went out. Will you be deaf to the
no less piteous Indian cry?" This single
sentence shows, I suppose, that Mr. Webster
was thinking of a speech to be made
in the Senate in the cause of the Indians,
and also what, as we have said, was his
usual method of preparation, that he intended
to compose a few sentences in a
complete form, the rest of the speech being,
so far as composition was concerned,
extempore.

The following is from Aaron Burr, containing
little in itself, other than the autograph,
and the fact that it in all probability
relates to the case of which Mr. Todd
tells the story in his delightful paper in the
"Green Bag," as follows:
</p>

<p>
"The late Judge Tenney, of Maine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
told me that Mr. Webster, when at Portsmouth,
heard one of Mr. Mason's students
say that the 'old man' had been much
puzzled over a particular law difficulty,
but had settled it. Mr. Webster inquired
what it was, and what was Mr. Mason's
solution, and did not forget it. A few
years after, in New York, Aaron Burr, one
of the ablest lawyers of his time, applied
to Mr. Webster for his opinion on this very
question, and was surprised to hear his
ready answer, that of Mr. Mason."

<p>
The tone of hostility in the following
letter from Benton is not explained, so far
as I know, by any occurrence which history
has preserved. If it implied a threat
of a challenge, undoubtedly Mr. Webster
bore himself on the occasion as became
a Senator from Massachusetts, as he did
in dealing with the fiery-hearted John Randolph,
and as Henry Wilson afterward
did in dealing with Preston S. Brooks:

Among the books in my possession belonging

Mr. Webster's scrupulous care of his
dress is well known. On each of the occasions
I saw him, his dress&mdash;which, as is
well known, was the blue coat with the
buff or white vest and brass buttons, and,
at least on one occasion in the summer,
white trousers&mdash;seemed to have been nearly
new. I was told by a lady who heard
the eulogy on Adams and Jefferson in
1826, in Faneuil Hall that on that occasion
he wore a gown.

There are in literature a few biographies
in which the hand of a master has,
in a brief compass, given a portraiture of
an illustrious subject, which, like the faces
portrayed by the great painters of the
Middle Ages, leaves nothing wanting and
which no fulness of detail could improve.
Of these, Tacitus's "Life of Agricola" is
probably the most perfect example. Kirkland's
"Fisher Ames" is of the same class.
So, also, unless I am greatly deceived, is
the "Life of Daniel Webster," by Edward
Everett, published with Webster's Works
in 1852. This admirable biography, partly,
perhaps, by reason of its place in a
voluminous publication, has attracted far
less attention than its own excellence and
the fame of its author would lead us to
expect. It will be worth all the pains taken
in preparing these articles if it shall
lead the youth of the country to study carefully
this masterly portrait by one great
statesman and orator of another who was
his teacher, leader, and friend. I extract
from it one passage which gives the key
to Webster's great success and to the success
of every great orator who has stirred
the feeling or convinced the understanding
of the people by the power of eloquent
speech:
</p>

<p>
"The orator who would do justice to a
great theme or a great occasion must
thoroughly study and understand the subject;
he must accurately and, if possible,
minutely digest in writing beforehand the
substance, and even the form, of his address;
otherwise, though he may speak
ably, he will be apt not to make in all respects
an able speech. He must entirely
possess himself beforehand of the main
things which he wishes to say, and then
throw himself upon the excitement of the
moment and the sympathy of the audience.
In those portions of his discourse
which are didactic or narrative, he will
not be likely to wander, in any direction,
far from his notes; although even in those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
portions new facts, illustrations, and suggestions
will be apt to spring up before him
as he proceeds. But when the topic rises,
when the mind kindles from within,
and the strain becomes loftier, or bolder,
or more pathetic, when the sacred fountain
of tears is ready to overflow, and audience
and speaker are moved by one
kindred sympathetic passion, then the
thick-coming fancies cannot be kept
down, the storehouse of the memory is
unlocked, images start up from the slumber
of years, and all that the orator has
seen, read, heard, or felt returns in distinct
shape and vivid colors. The cold
and premeditated text will no longer suffice
for the glowing thought. The stately,
balanced phrase gives place to some abrupt,
graphic expression, that rushes unbidden
to his lips. The unforeseen incident
or locality furnishes an apt and
speaking image; and the discourse instinctively
transposes itself into a higher
key."

<p>
Like many other energetic and successful
men, Mr. Cutting had his
enemies. When, as counsel for the
East End Land and Traction Company,
he discovered that the policy of a majority
of the Board of Directors was to slowly
but surely "freeze out" the smaller stockholders,
he promptly resigned his position,
and proceeded to form a coalition among
the to-be-frozen. This coalition had for
its object the overthrow of the existing
management and the subsequent instituting
of a new and generous policy.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">Michael O'Connor.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After a hard, stubborn fight, Mr. Cutting
and his followers won; the management
was displaced, and Mr. Cutting
again became counsel for the company.
But he had added to his list of enemies
some who, though few in number, were
long of memory, relentless, and powerful.
</p>

<p>
Under the new <i>régime</i> the company
prospered, and the patient stockholders
received their dividends regularly, hitherto
withheld or, rather, made to appear non-existing
by means of the well-known device
of undervaluing the company's lands
in converse ratio to its increasing earnings.
</p>

<p>
The annual meeting was but two days
off, and Mr. Cutting's sky seemed clear
and tranquil; but overnight clouds had
gathered black and ominous. The enemy,
believing themselves once more superior
in strength, or nearly enough so to venture
upon the step, at the last moment
sounded the note of war. That evening's
paper contained insinuations, which were
followed in the morning editions by large
headlines and by direct though guarded
accusations.
</p>

<p>
It was this morning, the morning of the
very day before the annual meeting, that I
was sitting in the office reading these same
accusations. I was indignant and tired
out.
</p>

<p>
All the night before I had been closeted
with Mr. Cutting in his house, working
out with him a defence for use in the
battle to come, writing to this or telegraphing
to that out-of-town holder of the
stock; in one instance even cabling to
London for a proxy allowing Mr. Cutting
to vote a thousand shares held by a friend
of his who was abroad. Together we had
gone through the long list of stockholders,
checking off those for and those
against us, and embodying in a new list
the names, not a few, of those either uncertain
or unknown to us. This list comprised
the names of almost all the smaller
holders, owning from one to fifty shares.
The only large holding was that of one
Andrew J. Ahearn, against whose name
appeared the goodly figure of five hundred
shares. But, alas! he was among
the unknown to us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As I was leaving the house Mr. Cutting
had said to me, mournfully: "I'm afraid
they've got us this time. We need four
thousand shares more, counting Emley's
as safe; and the cable may not reach him
in time, or he may be out of London. But,
never mind," he added, clapping me warmly
on the shoulder; "we will fight 'em till
they knock us out, and go for 'em again
next year. See you at the office."
</p>

<p>
As I walked slowly home to my lodgings
through the long, level shadows of the
early morning, the distinct rattling of incoming
milk-carts and the twitter of
countless sparrows pulsed through my
tired brain in throb with the names of big
and little stockholders. Thus, after a
bath and breakfast, I had reached the office
tired and indignant over the unjust
and unwarranted attacks upon Mr. Cutting
contained in the morning papers.
Though counsel in name, he was in fact
the managing head of the company's affairs.
</p>

<p>
As I sat at my desk, the newspapers lying
about on the floor where I had thrown
them in my anger, the door opened and
old O'Connor entered.
</p>

<p>
Unlike his former appearances upon the
scene of Mr. Cutting's domain, he did not
wait to be spoken to, but crossed to me
briskly, without hesitation or apology,
merely removing his tall hat and sweepingly
smoothing his thin white hair as he sat
himself down firmly in a chair directly
facing me. Something was on his mind,
evidently.
</p>

<p>
"Phwat's dthis the papers do be sayin'
about Mr. Cuttin', sor," he began, but,
remembering himself, hastened to add,
"Good-morning, sor. And how is Mr.
Cutting this morning, sor?"
</p>

<p>
I told him that Mr. Cutting was well.
Then I explained to him that the newspaper
attacks were instigated by the old
Board of Directors of the East End Company,
who were trying to oust Mr. Cutting
and his friends from the directorate. At
receiving this piece of information he
merely remarked, tersely, "The divils!"
and after a pause added, in a whisper,
"Shure, Mr. Cuttin' can down the whole
av thim&mdash;&mdash;" Then, with a note of anxiety
in his voice, "Can't he, now, sor?"
</p>

<p>
I replied that it looked very doubtful,
the time left us being so short and the
other side having prepared themselves so
secretly.
</p>

<p>
"And phwat's dthis," O'Connor went
on, an angry look still more contracting
his wizened face and concentrating all his
features to a point at the tip of his short
up-turned nose&mdash;"phwat's dthis they do
be sayin'&mdash;Chimmie, me bar-tender, was
afther readin' ut to me&mdash;phwat's dthis
about Mr. Cuttin' mismanaging the
money?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the money," I hastened to say;
"the affairs of the company."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;annyho-ow, 'tis a dommed
lie," said O'Connor, thrusting out his
square chin farther and farther with each
word as it escaped from between the compressed
wide lips, which at last opened in
a far from pleasant grin, showing his still
sound if ragged teeth, as he ejaculated,
with fine distinctness, "The blay-gyards!"
and then asked, with sudden eagerness,
"Do there be anny wan av thim oi knaw,
now?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, laughingly, "unless you
happen to have met the former president,
Mr. Walker;" thinking that that gentleman
would in all probability be the least
likely to be among the O'Connor's acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
"Phwat Walker is this?" he asked, all
interest and expectation.
</p>

<p>
"The former president," I said.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not Jarge Double-ye, it is, now,
is ut?" He was leaning forward, looking
eagerly into my eyes, his hands tightly
clutching his knees.
</p>

<p>
"It is," I replied. "George W. Walker."
</p>

<p>
"An' <i>do I know him</i>!" he exclaimed,
leaning back and throwing up both hands,
as if exhausted with amazement. "An'
it's the loikes av him is fightin' Mr. Cuttin',
is ut?" I nodded. "Well, well,
well!" he murmured, softly. "<i>Phwat</i> do
ye dthink av that! Whishper! Sit still,
there, you."
</p>

<p>
He rose and tiptoed quickly to the
door, opened it, and with an imperative
backward jerk of the head summoned
somebody from the hallway without. In
a few moments a small elderly woman
squeezed into the room. She was dressed
in black and carried her hands clasped in
front of her, seeming to hold in place the
corners of a shawl that, folded over her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
shoulders, was crossed at her waist. Her
bonnet was diminutive, but somehow uncompromising,
almost defiant, in its plainness.
From beneath it peeped a portion,
but enough, of a smooth brown wig. By
it I recognized her. She was the consort
of the lineal descendant of the last king
of Ireland; she was O'Connor's wife and
Mollie's, now Mrs. Fennessey's, mother.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
"Ah! Mrs. O'Connor!" I exclaimed,
rising, "how do you do? I am glad to
see you again."
</p>

<p>
She merely courtesied sharply and sniffed
once. She was not nearly so gracious
and so comfortably confiding as she had
been in the state chamber of her own
castle, where I last saw her. However,
she remarked at length, pleasantly enough,
that "it was a rale plisint mornin', the
day," and seated herself in a chair near
the door. For perhaps a minute O'Connor
stood by her side and whispered to
her. She seemed interested. I caught the
sound of "Jarge Double-ye" from him,
and a crisp and threatening "Ho, ho!"
from her in reply. Then they crossed to
my desk, O'Connor drawing a folded
paper from his pocket as he came. His
manner now was grave and business-like.
</p>

<p>
"Av you plaze, sor, Mrs. O'Connor
and mesilf would thank you if you would
be so kind as to lit us j'intly sign this
paper forninst ye."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to witness the signatures?
Is that it?" I asked, taking the
paper and mechanically starting to unfold
it.
</p>

<p>
"Yis, sor. But 'tis&mdash;excuse me, sor&mdash;'tis
a private matther. Read it, sor, if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused, much embarrassed.
I hastened to assure him it was not necessary
for me to read it, and, smoothing
down the lowest fold of the document,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
handed O'Connor a well-filled pen. He,
in turn, handed it to his wife, with the
words, "Sign you, Bridget Ann, fur-rst,
and I'll sign afther, meself."
</p>

<p>
"Where do I putt me name, Michael,
dear?" she asked, now seated uneasily at
my desk.
</p>

<p>
"Just undher the worruds 'Wid my
consint,'" he answered, pointing with a
short, knotty, curved index-finger to the
words "So help me, God," which appeared
on the right side of the sheet, just below
the edge of the folded section that covered
the remainder of the writing, except
the words "With my consent," which
were on the same line, but at the left. I
corrected his mistake.
</p>

<p>
Slowly and awkwardly, but with great
patience, Mrs. O'Connor's signature was
constructed. If a decided upward slant
indicates, as students of chirography assert,
that the writer is of sanguine and ambitious
temperament, the lady was surely a
worthy spouse for an heir to the throne of
Ireland. The signature ran up, up, up,
until balked by the folded edge; but pressing
against this obstacle, it ran its remaining
course in protest against its confinement.
Whether or not it spelled Bridget
Ann O'Connor, it certainly spelled nothing
else.
</p>

<p>
O'Connor, as usual, had left his spectacles
at home. I signed his name and an
×, while he softly touched the tip of my
pen-holder. He sighed with relief when
it was over, and remarked: "Shure, cross
or name, 'tis all the same. There's no
differ. Thank you kindly, sor, and phwat
do I owe you, now?"
</p>

<p>
As I waved away his question, Mr.
Cutting came in from the company's offices,
which adjoined our own.
</p>

<p>
Despite his anxieties, Mr. Cutting greeted
O'Connor with his usual cheery, "Well,
Michael, how are you?" and then seeing
Mrs. O'Connor, crossed to her and shook
hands; after which she resumed her seat,
and sniffed once more&mdash;this time with
more decision and with her nose in the air.
<i>She</i> knew she knew Henry H. Cutting,
Esq., whether the rest of the world knew
she did or not.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Michael, what can I do for you
to-day?" he asked, pleasantly. O'Connor
was immediately all confusion. As he
tried to answer, he fumbled with his tall
hat (which he had hurriedly grasped from
its resting-place on my desk at Mr. Cutting's
entrance), he pulled with gentle uncertainty
at the fringe of white beard that
encircled his anxious face, while his eyes
followed the line of the washboard as if
searching there for encouragement.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong?" asked Mr. Cutting.
</p>

<p>
"No, sor; no, Mr. Cuttin'," O'Connor
at last stammered. "Not wid me, nor
yit wid anny belongin' to me. But, Mr.
Cuttin', sor, I do be hearin' av&mdash;av&mdash;phwat
the papers&mdash;&mdash;" He paused.
</p>

<p>
I saw a look of pain and disappointment
quickly cross Mr. Cutting's face, and
I read his thoughts on the instant. His
old servant and friend, doubtful of its security,
had come to demand his money.
</p>

<p>
"Av phwat the papers do be sayin'
about you," O'Connor at last gained courage
to say, "and av phwat thim blaygyards
do be havin' in moind to do to you,
sor. So-o I wud&mdash;meanin' no presumshin,
sor, and wid your kind permission&mdash;be
afther givin' you this, sor. I dic<i>tay</i>ted
it and me daughter, Mollie, that's now
Mrs. Fennessey, wrote it down for me.
Av you plaze, sor."
</p>

<p>
He handed Mr. Cutting the paper I
had witnessed, and was gently rising and
falling on his toes, holding his tall hat behind
him in both hands, while he nervously
moistened his lips and gazed at the wall.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting read the paper quickly,
then walked abruptly to the window and
stood looking out. There was silence for
several moments. O'Connor continued
his gentle rising and falling. Mrs. O'Connor
sighed softly, smoothed her gown by
a touch or two, and again folded her
hands. Then Mr. Cutting turned and
resting his left hand, which still held the
paper, on O'Connor's shoulder, with his
right grasped the other's right and shook
it warmly. There was the glitter of moisture
in his eyes, but his fine face wore an
expression of mingled affection and mirth.
</p>

<p>
"Michael," he said, his clear, musical
voice firm and kind, "I thank you with
all my heart for your generous offer of assistance.
And you, too, Bridget." Mrs.
O'Connor half rose, sat down again and
sniffed. "But I cannot&mdash;it would not be
right for me to accept it."
</p>

<p>
Then followed a wholly unwritable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
scene&mdash;O'Connor and his wife, by turns
and at times together, protesting, insisting,
assuring, even coaxing. In the <i>mêlée</i> of
warm-hearted Irish explosives, I could distinguish,
"Shure, I've plinty money"&mdash;"More
than plinty, he has"&mdash;"What wid
me rum"&mdash;"Yis, an' your junk"&mdash;"And
me rints"&mdash;"There's a good man, now"
"No bodther at all, at all." But at last
O'Connor caught a look in his former employer's
eye that he knew. He saw that
further argument or entreaty was useless.
At a gesture from Mr. Cutting, he and his
wife desisted.
</p>

<p class="caption">Slowly and awkwardly, but with great patience, Mrs. O'Connor's signature was constructed.&mdash;<a href="#Page_224">Page 224</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
"No, Michael," Mr. Cutting continued,
quietly; "it is impossible. It is out of the
question. Besides, I must tell you, and
now seems a good time, that while my affairs
are in no danger, they are, owing to
this new development in the company's
prospects, causing me a good deal of trouble
and anxiety. I have, therefore, turned the
property of yours I was holding into cash,
and it is now in my bank. I want you to
wait here while I send and draw it out.
Then I am going to ask you to take care
of it yourself&mdash;at least, for the present. I
am happy to say the amount has increased
considerably, and I know you won't be
disappointed."
</p>

<p>
His tone was firm, and his determination
manifest. O'Connor humbly acquiesced
with his familiar "Phwativer you
plaze, sor, Mr. Cutting, sor." Then Mr.
Cutting said:
</p>

<p>
"But there is one thing you can do for
me, Michael, and I shall be very much
obliged to you if you will."
</p>

<p>
"I will, then," said O'Connor, brightening.
"Phwat is ut?"
</p>

<p>
"Give me this paper," said Mr. Cutting,
holding up the paper O'Connor had handed
him.
</p>

<p>
"Shure I will, sor, if you want it. 'Tis
no use to me now." His sadness had returned,
and now held him completely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting then disappeared into the
company's offices; but in passing my desk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
on the way he laid the paper before me,
whispering as he did so, "Read that."
</p>

<p>
O'Connor and his wife were now conversing
apart, in mournful numbers, so I
read, unobserved, this:
</p>

<p class="p2">
  "I, Michael O'Connor, being of sound
and disposing mind, this day do hereby
loan to Mr. Henry H. Cutting, Esq., for
any use he please, all my money he has
now in charge, him to repay whenever it
suits his convenience, and if never at all,
no matter at all.
</p>

<div class="signature-container">
<p class="center">"So help me God.</p>

<p class="signature">"<i>Michael</i><br />
"his × mark<br />
"<i>O'Connor</i>.
</p>
</div>

<p class="s08">"With my consent,<br />
"<i>Bridget Ann O'Connor</i>."
</p>
</div>

<p>
You may be sure it found a safe abiding-place
among Mr. Cutting's most cherished
possessions. He soon came back
into the office, alert and eager, a new light
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Mike," he exclaimed, so suddenly that
O'Connor dropped his hat, "perhaps you
<i>can</i> help me after all."
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to God!" exclaimed O'Connor,
looking at him, though groping for
his hat, which had rolled in a short semi-circle
to his wife's feet and was now safely
reposing in her lap. "How, sor?"
</p>

<p>
"Parker," said Mr. Cutting turning to
me, "let me have that copy of the list of
the uncertain and unknown. Ah!" as he
took it and with a flirt opened it. "Michael,
see if you can tell me anything of
these people. Perhaps you may know the
first one on the list&mdash;Andrew J. Ahearn,
five hundred shares."
</p>

<p>
"Andy Ahearn!" replied O'Connor, in
interested surprise. "Yis, sor, shure I
know Andy Ahearn these t'irty years&mdash;more
shame to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ho! Thrue for you," came from
Mrs. O'Connor's direction.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of man is he?" Mr. Cutting
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Shure, he do go round pickin' up
bur-rnt matches against the day there's
no builder left who'll give him firewood;
and him wort' his t'ousands upon t'ousands.
And now I think av it, sor, I
can tell ye how he kem by thim five hunder'
shares." Here the old man became
very deliberate and precise. "Now, d'ye
moind, he is&mdash;no-o&mdash;he was father to
Carneelus Ahearn, him that was in the
Legis<i>lay</i>ter five year ago. 'Twas thin
d'ye moind, your company&mdash;as it is no-ow&mdash;was
petishinin' for a&mdash;phwat's this ut
is&mdash;a franchise. Well, I dunno-o; but thin
it was many av thim in the Legis<i>lay</i>ter got
shares av stock. Some sez they bought
thim, and odthers sez&mdash;but that's neidther
here nor there, at all, at all, and av no
consequince now. But 'twas this same
Carneelus, d'ye moind, son to Andy, that
was afther give a term av five years in
jail, for&mdash;for&mdash;phwat's this they calls
shtealin' whin it ain't shtealin', now?"
</p>

<p>
"Embezzlement," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That's ut," said O'Connor. "An' he
died two years afther, wid t'ree year yet
comin' to him. So, now, d'ye moind how
ould Andy Ahearn kem by the five hunder'
shares? He bought thim arf av his
son, Carneelus."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you could get him to
give you a proxy?" Mr. Cutting asked.
</p>

<p>
"An' phwat's that, sor, av you plaze?"
</p>

<p>
"Shure, Michael, dear," came in cooing
accents from the lady across the room,
"a proxy is a godfather or a godmother
whin they are unabil to be prisint."
</p>

<p>
I tried not to laugh, and Mr. Cutting
turned his head to hide a smile; but
O'Connor saw that something was wrong.
Turning toward his wife, he said, impressively:
</p>

<p>
"Shure, Bridgit Ann, 'tis not ba-abies
we're dishcussin', dear. 'Tis business, it
is."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting and I finally succeeded in
giving him a fairly good idea of what a
proxy was.
</p>

<p>
"Shure, 'tis a permit fer me to vote fer
him as I plaze, thin?" he asked, at last.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting said that that was near
enough for all practical purposes, and
went on reading from the list of names,
selecting those of evident or probable
Celtic origin. It was amazing how many
the old couple knew, either personally or
by hearsay. In many instances Mrs.
O'Connor was with difficulty restrained
from giving a complete family history of
the person in question. As the reading
progressed they became more and more
excited and enthusiastic, until at last
O'Connor broke out with:
</p>

<p>
"Nivver moind the rist, sor. Gimme
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
the list av the whole av thim, and a
boonch av thim godfa&mdash;I mane, thim
proxies."
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="456" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"There's a good man, now&mdash;no bodther at all, at all."&mdash;<a href="#Page_225">Page 225</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
"And moind you take Chimmie along
wid you, Michael," said Mrs. O'Connor,
grasping at once her husband's intention
and eagerly espousing it. "Chim knows
manny as well as you, and some betther.
Thin, he is eddi<i>cay</i>ted, too, Michael, dear.
And I'll get Tim to come over and tind
bar, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Thrue for you, Bridgit Ann," said
O'Connor, warmly. "'Tis Chimmie an'
me will do the job this day."
</p>

<p>
I gave him a handful of printed blanks
to use for the proxies, and Mr. Cutting
handed him the list of names. He disposed
of these summarily in the capacious
pocket of his coat, caught his wife by the
arm, and together they started to go.
</p>

<p>
At this moment a clerk entered and
handed Mr. Cutting O'Connor's money.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, Michael," he called. "Here's
your money; and here"&mdash;reaching for a
paper in his desk&mdash;"is an account of how
we stand. It is all there. Look it over at
your leisure."
</p>

<p>
O'Connor hesitated, a last look of pleading
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
in his eyes; then took the money and
account, thrust them deep into his trousers
pocket, and hurried to the door. This he
partly opened, and he and milady scurried
funnily through the narrow space, like a
pair of elderly black puppies. The door
closed behind them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting leaned back in his chair,
and laughed for a full minute. Then he
asked me to bring him the signed dictation.
I did so. He read it through once
more, laughed again, and sighed:
</p>

<p>
"God bless him! Being of sound and
disposing mind this day, I will take the
will for the deed." He sat for a moment
in thought; then holding the paper before
him, he said, musingly: "Few, very, very
few are those in <i>this</i> world so broadly eddi<i>cay</i>ted
as to have dic<i>tay</i>ted this."
</p>

<p>
"There are few of the blood royal," I
ventured to remark.
</p>

<p>
"And more's the pity," he said, as the
lock of his lacquered dispatch-box clicked.
For a time we were silent.
</p>

<p>
"It just occurs to me," I said at last,
"that we forgot to have him sign a receipt."
</p>

<p>
"Receipt, man!" he exclaimed. "A
receipt from <i>him</i>? Besides, we have Bridget
Ann as a witness." And chuckling, he
passed again into the company's offices.
</p>

<p>
Not until the very hour of the day of the
meeting did we realize that we had entirely
forgotten to instruct O'Connor to have
such proxies as he might get made out in
Mr. Cutting's name.
</p>

<p>
The morrow came, and with it the meeting.
The stockholders were not present
in large numbers, but enough were there to
crowd uncomfortably the directors' room
where the meeting was held. O'Connor
had not put in an appearance, nor had we
heard from him since his and his wife's hurried
departure of the day before. Our side
was not a very hopeful party. True, Emley
had cabled his attorney to give Mr.
Cutting a proxy, and it was now safe in
Mr. Cutting's possession, with the others
he had obtained. But we were sure of
only twenty-two thousand out of a total
of fifty thousand shares, and to our knowledge
(now, alas! at the last moment) the
other side had been working like beavers
to obtain proxies. Still, there was a chance
for us. It is as misleading to count your
proxies before they are voted, as to count
your chickens before they are hatched.
Some of the enemy's might be revoked at
any moment, or be superseded by others
bearing later dates. At any rate, preparation
was passed. The fight was on.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting was seated at the side of
the room, surrounded by a little group of
his fellow-directors and friends. I was
beside the president, the necessary books
and papers at my hand, ready to perform
my duties as secretary. It was a position
I held through Mr. Cutting's kindness and
influence. At last the president called the
meeting to order.
</p>

<p>
The reading of the minutes of the previous
meeting was dispensed with, for
which I was grateful. Something in the
air told me that the enemy were eager for
action. As many formalities as could be
were omitted or summarily disposed of.
The instant the treasurer's report had
been read and accepted, Mr. Walker, the
ex-president, was on his feet.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a very able, if wholly
misleading, attack upon the policy pursued
by the board of directors during
their term of office. Mr. Walker was a
man of force and a good speaker; and his
remarks had their effect upon not a few
uncertain ones, if one could judge by the
look of approval apparent on the faces of
many who were present. But as he neared
the end, either his personal enmity toward
Mr. Cutting or the excitement due to the
occasion, got the better of his judgment.
He closed by a personal attack upon the
counsel, whom he characterized as "the
non-commissioned general who had cunningly
devised this whole campaign of extravagance,
wickedly designed to elate
and bamboozle the smaller stockholders,
who, when the inevitable result of such
reckless expenditure should come&mdash;namely,
a crash&mdash;would find themselves obliged
to sell their little hard-earned holdings."
"To whom," Mr. Walker ended, "it is
hardly necessary for me to say."
</p>

<p>
From where I sat I commanded a view
of the door that led directly into the corridor
of the building. Just as Mr. Walker's
spleen was beginning to take possession of
him, I saw this door open and O'Connor
enter. He was accompanied by a short,
stocky, red-haired young Irishman, whom
I recognized as his bartender, "Chimmie."
</p>

<p>
The old chap looked hot and excited,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
but not tired, and far from dejected. There
was a new alertness about him, much like
that you will see in an old and experienced
bull-terrier, who has every reason to believe
that the rat-trap is about to be opened. I
watched him.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-102.jpg" width="484" height="544" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"A proxy is a godfather or a godmother whin they are unabil to be prisint."&mdash;<a href="#Page_226">Page 226</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
With head bent forward, and with one
bunchy hand curled like a warped oyster-shell
about his ear, he listened to every
word. I saw him ask a man next him who
was speaking. I could tell that this was
his question by the effect the man's answer
produced upon him. His eyebrows lowered
and contracted, and from beneath
them he glared at "Jarge Double-ye,"
while the far from pleasant grin appeared,
grew, and hardened about his mouth.
Meanwhile he was gradually edging his
way forward, his faithful companion at his
elbow, nearer and nearer to the speaker.
In the general interest in Mr. Walker's remarks,
few noticed the pair.
</p>

<p>
At last the descendant of the last King
of Ireland was in a position squarely in
front of the speaker, and separated from
him by the width of the directors' long
table, upon which now reposed the old
tall hat so familiar to me and to Mr. Cutting.
</p>

<p>
The instant Mr. Walker was seated,
after his speech, he of the royal blood
seized his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prisidint," he said, firmly and
clearly, depositing his large red cambric
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
handkerchief in the hat beside him. The
president bowed, saying:
</p>

<p>
"You have the floor, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. Excuse
me; you are a stockholder, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I am, sor."
</p>

<p>
I was amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Your name, please."
</p>

<p>
"Michael O'Connor, twinty-wan &mdash;&mdash;
Wharf, junk-dealer and licensed liquor-seller."
</p>

<p>
There was a slight stir of expectancy
among those present. The president
glanced at me, waiting for me to verify
O'Connor's statement. I had run my
finger down the O's in the list of names,
well knowing, of course, O'Connor's was
not there. I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Your name does not seem to appear
on the list, Mr. O'Connor," said the president.
</p>

<p>
"Shure, I only bought me shtock this
mornin', sor," replied O'Connor with a reassuring
and comforting wave of the hand
to the chief officer of the company. Chimmie,
at his elbow still, handed him a paper
from a bunch of many he held ready in
his hand. O'Connor passed it up to the
president, with the remark, "Here is me
credintials, sor, av you plaze."
</p>

<p>
That gentleman merely glanced at it,
then returned it to O'Connor, and said,
</p>

<p>
"A certificate of stock, I see. Did you
expect to vote?"
</p>

<p>
"Dthat's phwat I kem here fer," said
O'Connor, with a quick nod of the head,
which showed that the royal blood was
stirring.
</p>

<p>
Then the president explained to him
that the transfer-books were closed, and
that, by the by-laws of the company, nobody
was allowed to vote at its meetings
except such persons as were duly registered
holders of its stock, or were holders
of a proxy from somebody who was.

wan." Jimmie handed him a second paper,
which he in turn handed to the president.

</p>
</div>

<p>
"This seems to be perfectly regular,
dated to-day, from Andrew J. Ahearn, for
five hundred shares," the president said,
and handed the proxy to me.
</p>

<p>
The stir of expectation had become a
ripple of excitement. I observed that Mr.
Walker moved uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Yis, sor," said O'Connor, with a touch
of ludicrous <i>aplomb</i>. "Andy Ahearn&mdash;shure,
the ould divil wouldn't give me the
wan widout I bought the odther. And
now, thin, sor, I have the privilege to vote,
is ut?"
</p>

<p>
The president bowed and looked about
the room for some other person who might
have business before the meeting.
</p>

<p>
"Thin I, Michael O'Connor," the old
fellow continued, to everybody's surprise
and amusement, "do hereby vote on these
five hunder' shares"&mdash;here he held the certificate
aloft in his right hand&mdash;"for Mr.
Hinry Haitch Cutting, Esquire, so help
me God, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a roar of laughter.
Mr. Walker was now on his feet.
When the laughter ceased, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. President, are we to take this stockholder
as a fair example of Mr. Cutting's
faithful following?"
</p>

<p>
The question was greeted with silence.
Mr. Walker had made a blunder, and he
was instantly made to feel it. O'Connor
spoke again, quietly and slowly, addressing
the presiding officer, but looking angrily
at the interrupter through half-closed
eyelids, his nose held high. As he spoke
he gently smoothed down his long upper lip
at the corners with thumb and forefinger.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prisidint," he said, "I think&mdash;I
dunno-o&mdash;but may-be-e&mdash;I have the
floo-or?"
</p>

<p>
The president bowed, but added that it
was not yet time to take a vote. Those
who are familiar with the Irish well know
how rarely you find one with absolutely
<i>no</i> knowledge of parliamentary procedure.
It seems to be imbibed with the mother's
milk. O'Connor was not in the least disconcerted.
"Thin, sor," he continued,
"wid your kind permission, I will make a
few remarks."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be glad to hear them, Mr.
O'Connor," the president said. A small
wave of approval passed over the meeting.
O'Connor placed his thumbs firmly in the
armholes of his waistcoat, planted his feet
well apart, and began. The royal blood
was up.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prisidint and gintlemin," with a
low, sweeping bow from left to right, "and
Jarge Double-ye Walker." Here he
cleared his throat to allow his sarcasm
time to penetrate the understanding of his
hearers. It did. "Whidther or not I am
a fair example uv <i>ahl</i> Mr. Hinry Haitch
Cutting Esquire's fait'ful follyers, I am
unabil to say, they bein' so large in noomber,
by God's justice. <i>But</i>, Mr. Prisidint
and gintlemin, and Jarge Double-ye
Walker, wid ahl modesty, I do claim to be
a fair example av some thirty-foor av Mr.
Hinry Haitch Cutting Esquire's fait'ful
follyers, who owns bechune thim two t'ousand
wan hunder' and sivin shares, countin'
me own five hunder'. They are ivery
wan av thim Oirish, includin' mesilf, and
I have the proxies av ivery wan av thim,
includin' me own. Put that in your poipe,
Jarge Double-ye Walker." The royal
blood was getting hot. A round of applause
burst from Mr. Cutting's party,
but it quickly subsided at the sharp rap
of the president's gavel upon the table.
This, however, had little effect upon
O'Connor. The royal blood was now at
boiling-point.
</p>

<p>
"Moreover, Jarge Double-ye Walker,"
he continued, too quickly for interruption,
and emphasizing each clause with clenched
fists, "they pays their taxes, they pays
their bills. They has paid for their little
hard-earned holdin's in this company, and&mdash;some
av thim owns tinimint-houses, but
not one wid bad plumbin' and defective
drainage, Jarge Double-ye Walker."
</p>

<p>
Caution had been royally thrown to the
winds. The president rapped hard and
long upon his desk. The listeners moved
uneasily in their seats.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Connor," the president said,
sharply, "you must confine your remarks
to the business in hand and address them
to the chair, or I must ask you to take
your seat."
</p>

<p>
"I ax your pardon, Mr. Prisidint,"
said O'Connor. He was now his old self,
and went on with homely courtesy, to say:
"It is my wish, sor, to say just a few
worruds more regyardin' me idee av phwat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
conshtitutes the fitness av a man for the job
av managin' the affairs av odthers than himself&mdash;wid
your kind permission, Mr. Prisidint,
and I'll not be long, at all, at all."
The president bowed. As the old Irishman
continued, his voice grew soft and
tender, at times sinking almost to a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"I am unabil, bein' mesilf uneddi<i>cay</i>ted
and a plain man, to deshcribe to yez just
phwat I'm wantin' to tell yez. But maybe
you'll know from this. Twinty year
ago come the tinth av this prisint month,
I wint to worruk for a certin gintleman,
to do chores about the place and phwat
gyardenin' and potherin' round the
grounds was nicissary. He had a purty
place in the country&mdash;a rale pur-rty place,
and there was a shweet little house there
he putt me in&mdash;all for mesilf and me wife
and me baby&mdash;a little gurrul she was, wan
year old. I had been to worruk in the
city, where I lived in a tinimint&mdash;noomber
t'ree Gay's Alley, so called it was. Me
wife was ailin', and the baby was takin'
afther her modther at the time; so, shure,
it was deloighted we was at the chanst to
live in the country and wid our new place.
A lovely home it was. Well, just tin days
afther we kem, me wife was tuk wid fever&mdash;typhide
fever it was&mdash;and two days
afther little Mollie was tuk, too, just the
same. Oh! wurra! wurra! but thim was
heart-breakin' days! But niver moind,
I'll not bodther you wid ahl av it. Wan
night me wife was terrible bad, little Mollie
bein' ashleep in the nixt room, and not
near so bad as her modther, to my thinkin'.
The docthor kem, and wid him the gintleman
that emplyed me. Whin the docthor
had looked at the two, he sez to me,
'The modther is very low,' he sez, 'but
she will come t'rough all right; but the
young un,' he sez, 'is in a viry criticil condition.
She'll need conshtant attintion,'
he sez, 'and I cannot be here mesilf,' he
sez, 'to save her life!' Me heart died in
me that minute.
</p>

<p>
"But quick, wid no hesitation, the gintleman
sez to the docthor, callin' him by
name, he bein' a frind av his, he sez,
'John,' he sez, 'I'll look afther the little
one mesilf durin' the night,' he sez. 'I've
done it before this, as you know,' he sez;
'and come again, you, in the mornin',' he
sez."
</p>

<p>
Here the old man paused. There was
perfect silence in the room. When he
again spoke, it was in a hoarse whisper,
but he could be distinctly heard.
</p>

<p>
"For t'ree whole nights&mdash;long, sad,
weary nights&mdash;the gintleman niver lift the
side av Mollie's bed, onliss whin he crep' in
to putt his hand on me shoulder and say to
me, 'Keep up, me man. We'll pull 'em
both t'rough, all right'&mdash;and we did that
same. Glory be to God and the Blessed
Virgin! they're alive and well this day, the
two av thim.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Prisidint and gintlemin, I am
not eddi<i>cay</i>ted and I dunno-o&mdash;I may
be wrong, but to my moind that gintleman
is the kind av a man that hav fitness for the
job av managin' the affairs av odthers beside
himself. And that gintleman is Mr.
Hinry Haitch Cutting, Esquire."
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked about him sheepishly;
then turning so as to face Mr. Walker,
he said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Jarge Double-ye Walker, I ax
your pardon for shpeakin' so rough to ye,
sor. 'Tis ahl past and gone now, sor, and
I bear ye no ill-will." Then to the president
he said, quietly, "Thank you kindly,
Mr. Prisidint;" and taking his hat,
moved back among those who were standing
near the door.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cutting now moved that we proceed
to the election of officers for the ensuing
year. The motion was carried.
</p>

<p>
When the ballots were counted, it was
found that the existing officers had received
the votes of twenty-seven thousand
and some odd shares, thus having a clear
majority. We could, of course, tell exactly
how many votes were due to O'Connor's
proxies; but how many more were due to
his personal presence at the meeting, we
could only estimate.

<p class="drop-cap">
There were marks of teeth
on his right boot, but no
marks at all on his body.
Fright&mdash;or fright following
on that evening's frenzy&mdash;had
killed him.
</p>

<p>
He was buried three days later, and Mr.
Raymond read the service. No rain had
fallen, and the blood of the three hounds
still stained the gravel dividing the grave
from the porch, where the crowd had shot
them down.
</p>

<p>
For awhile his death made small difference
to the family at the Parsonage.
They had fought the shadow of his enmity
and proved it for what it was; a shadow
and little else. But they had scarcely realized
their success, and wondered why the
removal of the shadow did not affect them
more.
</p>

<p>
About this time Taffy began to carry
out a scheme which he and his father had
often discussed, but hitherto had found no
leisure for&mdash;the setting up of wooden
crosses on the graves of the drowned sailormen.
They had wished for slate: but
good slate was expensive and hard to come
by, and Taffy had no skill in stone-cutting.
Since wood it must be, he resolved to put
his best work into it. The names, etc.,
should be engraved, not painted merely.
Some of the pew-fronts in the church had
panels elaborately carved in flat and shallow
relief&mdash;fine Jacobean designs, all of
them. He took careful rubbings of the
narrowest, made tracings, and set to work
to copy them on the face of his crosses.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, some three weeks after
the Squire's funeral, he happened to return
to the house for a tracing which he had
forgotten, and found Honoria seated in
the kitchen and talking with his father and
mother. She was dressed in black, of
course, and either this or the solemnity of
her visit gave her quite a grown-up look.
But to be sure, she was mistress of Tredinnis
now, and a child no longer.
</p>

<p>
Taffy guessed the meaning of her visit
at once. And no doubt this act of formal
reconciliation between Tredinnis House
and the Parsonage had cost her some
nervousness. When he entered his parents
stood up and seemed just as awkward as
their visitor. "Another time, perhaps,"
he heard his father say. Honoria rose almost
at once, and would not stay to drink
tea, though Humility pressed her.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Taffy next day, looking
up from his Virgil, "I suppose Miss
Honoria wants to make friends now, and
help on the restoration?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Raymond, who was on his knees
fastening a loose hinge in a pew-door,
took a screw from between his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she proposed that."
</p>

<p>
"It must be splendid for you, dad!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite see," answered Mr. Raymond,
with his head well inside the pew.
</p>

<p>
Taffy stood up, put his hands in his
pockets, and took a turn up and down
the aisle.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said he, coming to a halt, "it
means that you have won. It's victory,
dad, and <i>I</i> call it glorious!" His lip
trembled. He wanted to put a hand on
his father's shoulder, as any other comrade
would. But his abominable shyness
stood between.
</p>

<p>
"We won long ago, my boy." And
Mr. Raymond wheeled round on his
knees, pushed up his spectacles, and
quoted the famous lines, very solemnly
and slowly:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>And not by eastern windows only,</p>
<p class="i1">When daylight comes, comes in the light;</p>
<p>In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly,</p>
<p class="i1">But westward, look, the land is bright.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"I see," Taffy nodded. "And&mdash;I
say, that's jolly. Who wrote it?"
</p>

<p>
"A man I used to see in the streets of
Oxford, and always turned to stare after:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
a man with big oddly shaped feet and the
face of a god&mdash;a young tormented god.
Those were days when young men's
thoughts tormented them. Taffy," he
asked, abruptly, "should you like to go to
Oxford?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't, father!" The boy bit his lip
to keep back the tears. "Talk of something
else&mdash;something cheerful. It has
been a splendid fight, just splendid! And
now it's over I'm almost sorry."
</p>

<p>
"What is over?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose&mdash;now that Honoria
wants to help&mdash;we can hire workmen and
have the whole job finished in a month or
two at farthest: and you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Raymond stood up, and leaning
against a bench-end examined the thread
of the screw between his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"That is one way of looking at it, no
doubt," he said, slowly; "and I hope God
will forgive me if I have put my own pride
before His service. But a man desires to
leave some completed work behind him:
something to which people may point and
say, '<i>he</i> did it.' There was my book,
now: for years I thought that was to be my
work. But God thought otherwise and&mdash;to
correct my pride, perhaps&mdash;set me to
this task instead. To set a small forsaken
country church in order and make it worthy
of His presence&mdash;that is not the mission I
should have chosen. But so be it: I have
accepted it. Only, to let others step in at
the last and finish even this&mdash;I say He
must forgive me, but I cannot."
</p>

<p>
"Your book ... you can go
back to it and finish it."
</p>

<p>
"I have burnt it."
</p>

<p>
"Dad!"
</p>

<p>
"I burned it. I had to. It was a
temptation to me, and until I lifted it from
the grate and the flakes crumbled in my
hands, the surrender was not complete."
</p>

<p>
Taffy felt a sudden gush of pity. And
as he pitied, suddenly he understood his
father.
</p>

<p>
"It had to be complete?"
</p>

<p>
"Either the book or the surrender. My
boy"&mdash;and in his voice there echoed the
aspiration and the despair of the true
scholar who abhors imperfection and incompleteness
in a world where nothing is
either perfect or complete, "it is different
with you. I borrowed you, so to say, for
the time. Without you I must have failed;
but this was never your work. For myself,
I have been humble and learnt my lesson;
but, please God, you shall be my Solomon
and be granted a temple to build."
</p>

<p>
Taffy had lost his shyness now. He
laid a hand on his father's sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"We will go on, then."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we will go on."
</p>

<p>
"And Jacky? Where has he been?
I haven't seen him since the Squire died."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Raymond searched in his coat-pocket
and handed over a crumpled letter.
It ran:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="p2">
"<span class="smcap">Dear friend.</span>&mdash;This is to say that
you will not see me no more. The dear
Lord tells me I have made a cauch of it.
He don't say how, all He says is go and
do better somewheres else.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me a terrable thing to think
<i>Religion</i> can be bad for anny man. It
have done me such powars of good. The
late Moyle esq he was like a dirty pan all

</p>
</div>

<p>
After supper that night, in the Parsonage
kitchen, Humility kept rising from her
chair, and laying her needlework aside to
re-arrange the pans and kettles on the
hearth. This restlessness was so unusual
that Taffy, seated in the ingle with a book
on his knee, had half raised his head to
twit her when he felt a hand laid softly on
his hair, and looked up into his mother's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Taffy, should you like to go to Oxford?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't, mother!"
</p>

<p>
"But you can." The tears in her eyes
answered his at once. She turned to his
father. "Tell him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my boy, you can go," said Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
Raymond; "that is, if you can win a
scholarship. Your mother and I have
been talking it over."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;" Taffy began and could get
no farther. He knew nothing of his parents'
affairs except that they were poor:
he had always supposed, almost desperately
poor.
</p>

<p>
"We have money enough, with care,"
said Mr. Raymond.
</p>

<p>
But the boy's eyes were on his mother.
Her cheeks, usually so pale, were flushed;
but she turned her face away and walked
slowly back to her chair. "The lace-work,"
he heard her say: "I have been
saving ... from the beginning&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For this?" He followed and took
her hand. With the other she covered her
eyes; but nodded.
</p>

<p>
"O mother&mdash;mother!" He knelt and
let his brow drop on her lap. She ceased
to weep; her palms rested on his bowed
head, but now and then her body shook
with a sob that would not be restrained.
And but for the ticking of the tall clock
there was silence in the room.
</p>

<p>
It was wonderful; and the wonder of
it grew when they recovered themselves
and fell to discussing their actual plans.
In spite of his idolatry, Mr. Raymond
could not help remembering certain slights
which he, a poor miller's son, had undergone
at Christ Church. He had chosen
Magdalen, which Taffy knew to be the
most beautiful of all the colleges; and the
news that his name had been entered on
the college books for years past gave him
a delicious shock. It was now July. He
would matriculate in the October term,
and in January enter for a demyship. But
(the marvels followed so fast on each
other's heels) there would be an examination
held in ten days' time&mdash;actually in ten
days' time&mdash;a "Certificate" examination,
Mr. Raymond called it&mdash;which would excuse
the boy not only the ordinary Matriculation
test, but Responsions too. And,
in short, Taffy was to pack his box and go.
</p>

<p>
"But the subjects?"
</p>

<p>
"You have been reading them and the
prescribed books for four months past.
And I have had sets of the old papers by
me for a guide. Your mathematics are
shaky&mdash;but I think you should do well
enough."
</p>

<p>
It was now Humility's turn, and the discussion
plunged among shirts and collars.
Never had evening been so happy; and
whether they talked of mathematics or of
collars, Taffy could not help observing
how from time to time his father's and
mother's eyes would meet and say, as
plainly as words, "We have done rightly,"
"Yes, we have done rightly."
</p>

<p>
And the wonder of it remained next
morning, when he awoke to a changed
world and took down his books with a
new purpose. Already his box had been
carried into old Mrs. Venning's room, and
his mother and grandmother were busy,
the one packing and repacking, the other
making a new and important suggestion
every minute.
</p>

<p>
He was to go up alone, and to lodge in
Trinity College, where an old friend of
Mr. Raymond's, a resident fellow just then
abroad and spending his Long Vacation
in the Tyrol, had placed his own room at
the boy's service.
</p>

<p>
To see Oxford&mdash;to be lodging in college!
He had to hug his mother in the
midst of her packing.
</p>

<p>
"You will be going by the Great Western,"
she said. "You won't be seeing
Honiton on your way."
</p>

<p>
When the great morning came, Mr.
Raymond travelled with him in the van to
Truro, to see him off. Humility went upstairs
to her mother's room, and the two
women prayed together.

</p>

<p>
Taffy heard the voice
speaking above a noise
which his dreams confused
with the rattle of yesterday's
journey. He was
still in the train, rushing through the rich
levels of Somersetshire. He saw the broad
horizon, the cattle at pasture, the bridges
and flagged pools flying past the window&mdash;and
sat up, rubbing his eyes. Blenkiron,
the scout, stood between him and the
morning sunshine, emptying a can of water
into the tub beside his bed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Blenkiron wore a white waistcoat, and a
tie of orange scarlet and blue, the colors of
the College Servants Cricket Club. These
were signs of the Long Vacation. For the
rest his presence would have become an
archdeacon; and he guided Taffy's choice
of a breakfast with an air which suggested
the hand of iron beneath the glove of
velvet.
</p>

<p>
"And begging your pardon, sir, but will
you be lunching in?"
</p>

<p>
Taffy would consult Mr. Blenkiron's
convenience.
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, sir, we've arranged to play
Teddy 'All this afternoon at Cowley, and
the drag starts at one-thirty sharp."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll get my lunch out of college,"
said Taffy, wondering who Teddy
Hall might be.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, sir. I had, indeed, took
the liberty of telling the manciple that you
was not a gentleman to give more trouble
than you could 'elp. Fried sole, pot of
tea, toast, pot of blackberry jam, commons
of bread&mdash;" Mr. Blenkiron disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Taffy sprang out of bed and ran to the
open window in the next room. The
gardens lay below him&mdash;smooth turf
flanked with a border of gay flowers,
flanked on the other side with yews; and
beyond the yews, with an avenue of limes;
and beyond these, with tall elms. A
straight gravelled walk divided the turf.
At the end of it two yews of magnificent
spread guarded a great iron gate. Beyond
these the chimneys and battlements of
Wadham College stood gray against the
pale eastern sky, and over them the larks
were singing.
</p>

<p>
So this was Oxford; more beautiful
than all his dreams. And since his examination
would not begin until to-morrow,
he had a whole long day to make
acquaintance with her. Half a dozen
times he had to interrupt his dressing to
run and gaze out of the window, skipping
back when he heard Blenkiron's tread on
the staircase. And at breakfast again he
must jump up and examine the door. Yes,
there was a second door outside&mdash;a heavy
<i>oak</i>&mdash;just as his father had described.
What stories had he not heard about these
oaks! He was handling this one almost
idolatrously when Blenkiron appeared suddenly
at the head of the stairs. Blenkiron
was good enough to explain at some
length how the door worked; while Taffy,
who did not need his instruction in the
least, blushed to the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
For, indeed, it was like first love, this
adoration of Oxford; shamefast, shy of its
own raptures; so shy, indeed, that when
he put on his hat and walked out into the
streets he could not pluck up courage to
ask his way. Some of the colleges he
recognized from his father's description:
of one or two he discovered the names by
peeping through their gateways and reading
the notices pinned up by the porters'
lodges: for it never occurred to him that
he was free to step inside and ramble
through the quadrangles. He wondered
where the river lay, and where Magdalen,
and where Christ Church. He passed
along the Turl, and down Brasenose
Lane; and at the foot of it, beyond the
great chestnut-tree leaning over Exeter
wall, the vision of noble square, the dome
of the Radcliffe, and St. Mary's spire
caught his breath and held him gasping.
</p>

<p>
His feet took him by the gate of Brasenose
and across the High. On the farther
pavement he halted, round-eyed, held at
gaze by the beauty of the Virgin's Porch
with the creeper drooping like a veil over
its twisted pillars. High up, white pigeons
wheeled round the spire, or fluttered from
niche to niche, and a queer fancy took him
that they were the souls of the carved saints,
up there, talking to one another above the
city's traffic. At length he withdrew his
eyes, and reading the name "Oriel Street"
on an angle of the wall above him, passed
down a narrow by-lane in search of further
wonders.
</p>

<p>
The clocks were striking three when,
after regaining the High and lunching at
a pastry-cook's, Taffy turned down into
St. Aldates and recognized Tom Tower
ahead of him. The great gates were closed.
Through the open wicket he had a glimpse
of green turf and an idle fountain; and
while he peered in a jolly-looking porter
stepped out of the lodge for a breath of air
and nodded in the friendliest manner.
</p>

<p>
"You can walk through, if you want to.
Were you looking for anyone?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Taffy; and explained,
proudly, "My father used to be at Christ
Church."
</p>

<p>
The porter seemed interested. "What
name?" he asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Raymond."
</p>

<p>
"That must have been before my time.
I suppose you'll be wanting to see the Cathedral.
That's the door&mdash;right opposite."
</p>

<p>
Taffy thanked him, and walked across
the great empty quadrangle. Within the
Cathedral the organ was sounding and
pausing; and from time to time a boy's
voice broke in upon the music like a flute,
the pure treble rising to the roof as though
it were the very voice of the building and
every pillar sustained its petition, "<i>Lord
have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts
to keep this law!</i>" Neither organist nor
chorister was visible, and Taffy tiptoed
along the aisles in dread of disturbing
them. For the moment this voice adoring
in the noble building expressed to him the
completest, the most perfect thing in life.
All his own boyish handiwork, remember,
had been guided under his father's eye
toward the worship of God.
</p>

<p>
"<i>... and incline our hearts to keep
this law.</i>" The music ceased. He heard
the organist speaking, up in the loft; criticising,
no doubt: and it reminded him somehow
of the small sounds of home and his
mother moving about her house-work in
the hush between breakfast and noon.
</p>

<p>
He stepped out into the sunlight again,
and wandering through archway and cloister
found himself at length beyond the college
walls and at the junction of two avenues
of elms, between the trunks of which
shone the acres of a noble meadow, level
and green. The avenues ran at a right
angle, east and south; the one old, with
trees of magnificent girth, the other new
and interset with poplars.
</p>

<p>
Taffy stood irresolute. One of these
avenues, he felt sure, must lead to the
river; but which?
</p>

<p>
Two old gentlemen stepped out from
the wicket of the Meadow Buildings, and
passed him, talking together. The taller&mdash;a
lean man, with a stoop&mdash;was clearly
a clergyman. The other wore cap and
gown, and Taffy remarked, as he went by,
that his cap was of velvet; and also that
he walked with his arms crossed just
above the wrists, his right hand clutching
his left cuff, and his left hand his right
cuff, his elbows hugged close to his sides.
</p>

<p>
After a few paces the clergyman paused,
said something to his companion, and the
two turned back toward the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Were you wanting to know your
way?"
</p>

<p>
"I was looking for the river," Taffy
answered. He was thinking that he had
never in his life seen a face so full of
goodness.
</p>

<p>
"Then this is your first visit to Oxford?
Suppose, now, you come with us? and we
will take you by the river and tell you the
names of the barges. There is not much
else to see, I'm afraid, in Vacation time."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at his companion in the
velvet cap, who drew down an extraordinarily
bushy pair of eyebrows (yet he,
too, had a beautiful face) and seemed to
come out of a dream.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better, boy, if you come
up to Oxford to worship false gods."
</p>

<p>
Taffy was taken aback.
</p>

<p>
"Eight false gods in little blue caps,
seated in a trough and tugging at eight
poles: and all to discover if they can get
from Putney to Mortlake sooner than
eight other false gods in little blue caps
of a lighter shade! What do they do at
Mortlake when they get there in such a
hurry? Eh, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm sure I don't know," stammered
Taffy.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman broke out laughing, and
turned to him. "Are you going to tell us
your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Raymond, sir. My father used to be
at Christ Church."
</p>

<p>
"What? Are you Sam Raymond's
son?"
</p>

<p>
"You knew my father?"
</p>

<p>
"A very little. I was his senior by a
year or two. But I know something about
him." He turned to the other. "Let
me introduce the son of a man after your
own heart&mdash;of a man fighting for God in
the wilds, and building an altar there with
his own hands and by the lamp of sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know all this?" cried
Taffy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," the old clergyman smiled, "we
are not so ignorant up here as you suppose."
</p>

<p>
They walked by the river-bank, and
there Taffy saw the college barges and was
told the name of each. Also he saw a
racing eight go by: it belonged to the
Vacation Rowing Club. From the barges
they turned aside and followed the windings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
of the Cherwell. The clergyman did
most of the talking; but now and then
the old gentleman in the velvet cap interposed
a question about the church at
home, its architecture, the materials it was
built of, and so forth; or about Taffy's
own work, his carpentry, his apprenticeship
with Mendarva the smith. And to
all these questions the boy found himself
replying with an ease which astonished
him.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the old clergyman said, "There
is your College!"
</p>

<p>
And unperceived by Taffy a pair of
kindly eyes watched his own as they met
the first vision of that lovely tower rising
above the trees and (so like a thing of life
it seemed) lifting its pinnacles exultantly
into the blue heaven.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
All three had come to a halt. The boy
turned, blushing furiously.
</p>

<p>
"This is the best of all, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Boy," said old Velvet-cap, "do you
know the meaning of 'edification'? There
stands your lesson for four years to come,
if you can learn it in that time. Do you
think it easy? Come and see how it has
been learnt by men who have spent their
lives face to face with it."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the street by Magdalen
bridge, and passed under Pugin's gateway,
by the Chapel door and into the famous
cloisters. All was quiet here; so quiet
that even the voices of the sparrows chattering
in the ivy seemed but a part of the
silence. The shadow of the great tower
fell across the grass, on which (so a notice-board
announced) nobody was allowed to
walk.
</p>

<p>
"This is how one generation read the
lesson. Come and see how another, and
a later, read it."
</p>

<p>
A narrow passage led them out of gloom
into sudden sunlight; and the sunlight
spread itself on fair grass-plots and gravelled
walks, flower-beds and the pale yellow
façade of a block of buildings in the classical
style, stately and elegant, with a colonnade
which only needed a few promenading
figures in laced coats and tie-wigs
to complete the agreeable picture.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of that?"
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Taffy's thoughts had
run back to the theatre at Plymouth with
its sudden changes of scenery. And he
stood for a moment while he collected
them.
</p>

<p>
"It's different&mdash;that is," he added, feeling
that this was lame, "it means something
different; I cannot tell what."
</p>

<p>
"It means the difference between godly
fear and civil ease, between a house of
prayer and one of no-prayer. It spells the
moral change which came over this University
when religion, the spring and source
of collegiate life, was discarded. The
cloisters behind you were built for men
who walked with God."
</p>

<p>
"But why," objected Taffy, plucking
up courage, "couldn't they do that in the
sunlight?"
</p>

<p>
Velvet-cap opened his mouth. The
boy felt he was going to be denounced;
when a merry laugh from the old clergyman
averted the storm.
</p>

<p>
"Be content," he said to his companion;
"we are Gothic enough in Oxford
nowadays. And the lad is right too.
There was hope even for eighteenth-century
Magdalen while its buildings looked
on sunlight and on that tower. We lay
too much stress on prayer. The lesson of
that tower (with all deference to your amazing
discernment and equally amazing
whims) is not prayer, but praise. And between
ourselves, when all men unite to worship
God, it'll be praise, not prayer, that
brings them together.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Praise is devotion fit for noble minds,</p>
<p>The differing world's agreeing sacrifice...."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"Oh, if you're going to fling quotations
from a tapster's son at my head....
Let me see ... how does it go on?...
Where&mdash;something or other&mdash;different
faiths&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
Where Heaven divided faiths united finds...."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
And in a moment the pair were in hot
pursuit after the quotation, tripping each
other up, like two schoolboys at a game.
Taffy never forgot the last stanza, the last
line of which they recovered exactly in
the middle of the street, Velvet-cap standing
between two tram-lines, right in the
path of an advancing car, while he declaimed&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
"By penitence when we ourselves forsake,</p>
<p>'Tis but in wise design on piteous Heaven;</p>
<p>In praise&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p>
(The gesture was magnificent)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
In praise we nobly give what God may take,</p>
<p>And are without a beggar's blush forgiven.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
&mdash;Damn these trams!"
</p>

<p>
The old clergyman shook hands with
Taffy in some haste. "And when you
reach home give my respects to your
father. Stay, you don't know my name.
Here is my card, or you'll forget it."
</p>

<p>
"Mine too," said Velvet-cap.
</p>

<p>
Taffy stood staring after them as they
walked off down the lane which skirts the
Botanical Gardens. The names on the
two cards were famous ones, as even he
knew. He walked back toward Trinity
a proud and happy boy. Half-way up
Queen's Lane, finding himself between
blank walls, with nobody in sight, he even
skipped.
</p>

TAFFY GIVES A PROMISE
</h3>

<div class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-113.jpg" width="85" height="84" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
The postman halted by the
foot-bridge and blew his
horn. The sound sent the
rabbits scampering into
their burrows; and just as
they began to pop out
again, Taffy came charging across the
slope; whereupon they drew back their
noses in disgust, and to avoid the sand
scattered by his heels.
</p>

<p>
The postman held up a blue envelope
and waved it. "Here, 'tis come, at last!"
</p>

<p>
"It may not be good news," said Taffy,
clutching it, and then turning it over
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's true. And till you open
it, it won't be any news at all."
</p>

<p>
"I wanted mother to be the first to
know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well&mdash;only as you say, it
mightn't be good news."
</p>

<p>
"If it's bad news, I want to be alone.
But why should they trouble to write?"
</p>

<p>
"True again. I s'pose now you're sure
it <i>is</i> from them?"
</p>

<p>
"I can tell by the seal."
</p>

<p>
"Take it home, then," said the postman.
"Only if you think 'tis for the sake
of a twiddling sixteen shilling a week that
I traipse all these miles every day&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Taffy fingered the seal. "If you would
really like to know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't 'ee mention it. Not on any
account." He waved his hand magnanimously
and trudged off toward Tredinnis.
</p>

<p>
Taffy waited until he disappeared behind
the first sand-hill, and broke the
seal. A slip of parchment lay inside the
envelope.
</p>

<p>
"<i>This is to certify</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He had paused! He pulled off his cap
and waved it round his head. And once
more the rabbits popped back into their
burrows.
</p>

<p>
<i>Toot&mdash;toot&mdash;toot!</i>&mdash;It was that diabolical
postman. He had fetched a circuit
round the sand-hill, and was peeping round
the north side of it and grinning as he
blew.
</p>

<p>
Taffy set off running, and never stopped
until he reached the Parsonage and burst
into the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"Mother&mdash;it's all right! I've passed!"
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Somebody was knocking at the door.
Taffy jumped up from his knees and Humility
made the lap of her apron smooth.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in?" asked Honoria,
and pushed the door open. She stepped
into the middle of the kitchen and dropped
Taffy an elaborate courtesy. "A thousand
congratulations, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, how did you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I met the postman: and I
looked in through the window before
knocking."
</p>

<p>
Taffy bit his lip. "People seem to be
taking a deal of interest in us, all of a sudden,"
he said to his mother. Humility
looked distressed, uncomfortable. Honoria
ignored the snub. "I am starting for
Carwithiel to-day," she said, "for a week's
visit; and thought I would look in&mdash;after
hearing what the postman told me&mdash;and
pay my compliments."
</p>

<p>
She talked for a minute or two on
matters of no importance; asked after old
Mrs. Venning's health; and left, turning
at the door to give Humility a cheerful
little nod.
</p>

<p>
"Taffy, you ought not to have spoken
so." Humility's eyes were tearful.
</p>

<p>
Taffy's conscience was already accusing
him. He snatched up his cap and ran
out.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Honoria!"
</p>

<p>
She did not turn.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Honoria&mdash;I am sorry." He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
overtook her, but she turned her face
away. "Forgive me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She halted, and after a moment looked
him in the eyes. He saw then that she
had been crying.
</p>

<p>
"The first time I came to see you, <i>he</i>
whipped me," she said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry; please&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Taffy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Honoria."
</p>

<p>
"I said&mdash;Taffy."
</p>

<p>
"Honoria, then."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what it is to feel lonely,
here?"
</p>

<p>
Taffy remembered the afternoons when
he had roamed the sand-hills longing for
George's company. "Why, yes," said he;
"it used to be always lonely."
</p>

<p>
"I think we have been the loneliest
children in the whole world&mdash;you and I
and George; only George didn't feel it in
the same way. And now it's coming to
an end with you. You are going up to
Oxford, and soon you will have heaps of
friends. Can you not understand? Suppose
there were two prisoners, alone in
the same prison, but shut in different
cells; and one heard that the other's release
had come. He would feel&mdash;would
he not?&mdash;that now he was going to be
lonelier than ever. And yet he might be
glad of the other's liberty, and if the
chance were given, might be the happier
for shaking hands with the other and
wishing him joy."
</p>

<p>
Taffy had never heard her speak at all
like this.
</p>

<p>
"But you are going over to Carwithiel,
and George is famous company."
</p>

<p>
"I am going over to Carwithiel because
I hate Tredinnis. I hate every stone of
it, and will sell the place as soon as ever
I come of age. And George is the best
fellow in the world. Some day I shall
marry him (Oh, it's all arranged!) and we
shall live at Carwithiel and be quite happy;
for I like him, and he likes people to be
happy. And we shall talk of you. Being
out of the world ourselves, we shall
talk of you, and the great things you are
going to do, and the great things you are
doing. We shall say to each other, 'It's
all very well for the world to be proud of
him, but we have the best right; for we
grew up with him and know the stories he
used to tell us, and when the time came
for his going, it was we who waved from
the door'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Honoria&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But there is one thing you haven't
told; and you shall now, if you care to&mdash;about
your examination and what you did
at Oxford."
</p>

<p>
So he sat down beside her on a sand-hill
and told her; about the long low-ceiled
room in the quadrangle of the
Bodleian, the old marbles which lined the
walls, the examiner at the blue-baize table,
and the little deal tables (all scribbled over
with names and dates and verses and
ribald remarks) at which the candidates
wrote; also of the <i>viva voce</i> examination
in the ante-chamber of the Convocation
House. He told it all as if it were the
great event which he honestly felt it to
be.
</p>

<p>
"And the others," said she: "those
who were writing around you, and the examiner&mdash;how
did you feel toward them?"
</p>

<p>
Taffy stared at her. "I don't know
that I thought much about them?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you feel as if it was a battle,
and you wanted to beat them all?"
</p>

<p>
He broke out laughing. "Why the
examiner was an old man, as dry as a stick!
And the others&mdash;I hardly remember what
they were like&mdash;except one, a white-headed
boy with a pimply face. I couldn't help
noticing him, because, whenever I looked
up, there he was at the next table, staring
at me and chewing a quill."
</p>

<p>
"I can't understand," she confessed.
"Often and often I have tried to think
myself a man&mdash;a man with ambition. And
to me that has always meant fighting. I
see myself a man, and the people between
me and the prize have all to be knocked
down or pushed out of the way. But you
don't even see them&mdash;all you see is a pimply-faced
boy sucking a quill. Taffy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Honoria?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would write to me, when
you get to Oxford. Write regularly. Tell

[The following correspondence with
Mr. William Archer I insert continuously,
though it belongs to two different periods
of the year 1885. An anonymous review
of the <i>Child's Garden</i>, appearing in
March, gave R. L. S. so much pleasure
that he wrote to inquire the name of his
critic, and learned that it was Mr. Archer,
with whom he had hitherto had no acquaintance,
but with whom he thereupon
entered into friendly correspondence. The
"paper" referred to in the later letters
of October 25 to November 1, is one on
R. L. S. in general, which Mr. Archer
wrote over his own signature in <i>Time</i>, a
monthly magazine now extinct.]
</p>

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, March 29th, 1885.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Archer</span>,&mdash;Yes, I have
heard of you and read some of your
work; but I am bound in particular to
thank you for the notice of my verses.
"There," I said, throwing it over to the
friend who was staying with me, "it's
worth writing a book to draw an article
like that." Had you been as hard upon
me as you were amiable, I try to tell myself
I should have been no blinder to the
merits of your notice. For I saw there,
to admire and to be very grateful for, a
most sober, agile pen; an enviable touch;
the marks of a reader, such as one imagines
for one's self in dreams, thoughtful,
critical, and kind; and to put the top on
this memorial column, a greater readiness
to describe the author criticised than to
display the talents of his censor.
</p>

<p>
I am a man <i>blasé</i> to injudicious praise
(though I hope some of it may be judicious,
too), but I have to thank you for
<span class="smcap">the best Criticism I ever had</span>; and
am therefore, dear Mr. Archer, the most
grateful critickee now extant.

<p>
P.S.&mdash;I congratulate you on living in
the corner of all London that I like best
[Queen's Square, Bloomsbury]. <i>Apropos</i>,
you are very right about my voluntary
aversion from the painful sides of life.
My childhood was in reality a very mixed
experience, full of fever, nightmare, insomnia,
painful days and interminable
nights; and I can speak with less authority
of gardens than of that other 'land of
counterpane.' But to what end should
we renew these sorrows. The sufferings
of life may be handled by the very greatest
in their hours of insight; it is of its
pleasures that our common poems should
be formed; these are the experiences that
we should seek to recall or to provoke;
and I say with Thoreau, "What right
have I to complain, who have not ceased
to wonder?" and, to add a rider of my
own, who have no remedy to offer?

October 28th, 1885.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Archer</span>,&mdash;I have read your
paper with my customary admiration; it
is very witty, very adroit, it contains a
great deal that is excellently true (particularly
the parts about my stories and
the description of me as an artist in life):
but you will not be surprised if I do not
think it altogether just. It seems to me,
in particular, that you have wilfully read
all my works in terms of my earliest; my
aim, even in style, has quite changed in
the last six or seven years; and this I
should have thought you would have
noticed. Again, you first remark upon
the affectation of the italic names: a
practice only followed in my two affected
little books of travel, where a typographical
<i>minauderie</i> of the sort appeared to me
in character; and what you say of it,
then, is quite just. But why should you
forget yourself and use these same italics
as an index to my theology some pages
further on? This is lightness of touch
indeed; may I say, it is almost sharpness
of practice?
</p>

<p>
Excuse these remarks. I have been on
the whole much interested, and sometimes
amused. Are you aware that the praiser
of this "brave gymnasium" has not seen
a canoe nor taken a long walk since '79?
that he is rarely out of the house nowadays,
and carries his arm in a sling? Can
you imagine that he is a back-slidden
communist, and is sure he will go to Hell
(if there be such an excellent institution)
for the luxury in which he lives? And
can you believe that, though it is gaily
expressed, the thought is hag and skeleton
in every moment of vacuity or depression?
Can you conceive how profoundly
I am irritated by the opposite affectation
to my own, when I see strong men and
rich men bleating about their sorrows
and the burthen of life, in a world full of
"cancerous paupers," and poor sick children,
and the fatally bereaved, ay, and
down even to such happy creatures as
myself, who has yet been obliged to strip
himself, one after another, of all the pleasures
that he had chosen except smoking
(and the days of that I know in my heart
ought to be over), I forgot eating, which
I still enjoy, and who sees the circle of
impotence closing very slowly but quite
steadily around him? In my view, one
dank, dispirited word is harmful, a crime
of <i>lèse-humanité</i>, a piece of acquired evil;
every gay, every bright word or picture,
like every pleasant air of music, is a piece
of pleasure set afloat; the reader catches
it and, if he be healthy, goes on his way
rejoicing; and it is the business of art so
to send him, as often as possible.
</p>

<p>
For what you say, so kindly, so prettily,
so precisely, of my style, I must in
particular thank you: though even here,
I am vexed you should not have remarked
on my attempted change of manner:
seemingly this attempt is still quite
unsuccessful! Well, we shall fight it out
on this line if it takes all summer.
</p>

<p>
And now for my last word: Mrs.
Stevenson is very anxious that you should
see me, and that she should see you, in
the flesh. If you at all share in these
views, I am a fixture. Write or telegraph
(giving us time, however, to telegraph in
reply, lest the day be impossible), and
come down here to a bed and a dinner.
What do you say, my dear critic? I
shall be truly pleased to see you; and to
explain at greater length what I meant
by saying narrative was the most characteristic
mood of literature, on which point
I have great hopes I shall persuade you.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p>
<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;My opinion about Thoreau, and
the passage in <i>The Week</i>, is perhaps a
fad, but it is sincere and stable. I am still
of the same mind, five years later; did
you observe that I had said "modern"
authors? and will you observe again that
this passage touches the very joint of our
division? It is one that appeals to me,
deals with that part of life that I think
the most important, and you, if I gather
rightly, so much less so? You believe
in the extreme moment of the facts that
humanity has acquired and is acquiring;
I think them of moment, but still of
much less than those inherent or inherited
brute principles and laws that sit upon
us (in the character of conscience) as
heavy as a shirt of mail, and that (in the
character of the affections and the airy
spirit of pleasure) make all the light of
our lives. The house is, indeed, a great
thing, and should be rearranged on sanitary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
principles; but my heart and all my
interest are with the dweller, that ancient
of days and day-old infant, man.

<p>
An excellent touch is p. 584. "By instinct
or design he eschews what demands
constructive patience." I believe it is
both; my theory is that literature must
always be most at home in treating movement
and change; hence I look for them.
</p>

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, October 30th, 1885.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Archer</span>,&mdash;It is possible my
father may be soon down with me; he is
an old man and in bad health and spirits;
and I could neither leave him alone, nor
could we talk freely before him. If he
should be here when you offer your visit,
you will understand if I have to say no,
and put you off.
</p>

<p>
I quite understand your not caring to
refer to things of private knowledge. What
still puzzles me is how you ('in the witness
box'&mdash;ha! I like the phrase) should
have made your argument actually hinge
on a contention which the facts answered.
</p>

<p>
I am pleased to hear of the correctness
of my guess. It is then as I supposed;
you are of the school of the generous and
not the sullen pessimists; and I can feel
with you. I used myself to rage when I
saw sick-folk going by in their Bath-chairs;
since I have been sick myself (and always
when I was sick myself), I found life, even
in its rough places, to have a property of
easiness. That which we suffer ourselves
has no longer the same air of monstrous
injustice and wanton cruelty that suffering
wears when we see it in the case of
others. So we begin gradually to see that
things are not black, but have their strange
compensations; and when they draw towards
their worst, the idea of death is like
a bed to lie on. I should bear false witness
if I did not declare life happy. And
your wonderful statement that happiness
tends to die out and misery to continue,
which was what put me on the track of
your frame of mind, is diagnostic of the
happy man raging over the misery of
others; it could never be written by the
man who had tried what unhappiness was
like. And at any rate, it was a slip of the
pen: the ugliest word that silence has to
declare is a reserved indifference to happiness
and misery in the individual; it
declares no leaning toward the black, no
iniquity on the large scale in fate's doings,
rather a marble equality, dread not cruel,
giving and taking away and reconciling.
</p>

<p>
Why have I not written my <i>Timon</i>?
Well, here is my worst quarrel with you.
You take my young books as my last
word. The tendency to try to say more
has passed unperceived (my fault, that).
And you make no allowance for the slowness
with which a man finds and tries to
learn his tools. I began with a neat brisk
little style, and a sharp little knack of partial
observation; I have tried to expand
my means, but still I can only utter a
part of what I wish to say, and am bound
to feel; and much of it will die unspoken.
But if I had the pen of Shakespeare, I
have no <i>Timon</i> to give forth. I feel
kindly to the powers that be; I marvel
they should use me so well; and when I
think of the case of others I wonder too,
but in another vein, whether they may
not, whether they must not, be like me,
still with some compensation, some delight.
To have suffered, nay, to suffer,
sets a keen edge on what remains of the
agreeable. This is a great truth, and has
to be learned in the fire.&mdash;Yours very truly,
</p>

<p>
We expect you, remember that.
</p>

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">Skerryvore, Bournemouth</span>,
November 1st, 1885.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Archer</span>,&mdash;You will see that
I had already had a sight of your article
and what were my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
One thing in your letter puzzles me.
Are you, too, not in the witness box? And
if you are, why take a wilfully false hypothesis?
If you knew I was a chronic invalid,
why say that my philosophy was unsuitable
to such a case? My call for facts
is not so general as yours, but an essential
fact should not be put the other way about.
</p>

<p>
The fact is, consciously or not, you
doubt my honesty; you think I am making
faces, and at heart disbelieve my
utterances. And this I am disposed to
think must spring from your not having
had enough of pain, sorrow, and trouble in
your existence. It is easy to have too
much; easy also or possible to have too
little; enough is required that a man may
appreciate what elements of consolation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
and joy there are in everything but absolutely
overpowering physical pain or disgrace,
and how in almost all circumstances
the human soul can play a fair part. But
perhaps my hypothesis is as unlike the
truth as the one you chose. Well, if it be
so, if you have had trials, sickness, the
approach of death, the alienation of
friends, poverty at the heels, and have
not felt your soul turn round upon these
things and spur them under&mdash;you must
be very differently made from me, and
I earnestly believe from the majority of
men. But at least you are in the right to
wonder and complain.
</p>

<p>
To 'say all'? Stay here. All at
once? That would require a word from
the pen of Gargantua. We say each particular
thing as it comes up, and 'with
that sort of emphasis that for the time
there seems to be no other.' Words will
not otherwise serve us; no, nor even
Shakespeare, who could not have put <i>As
You Like It</i> and <i>Timon</i> into one without
ruinous loss both of emphasis and substance.
Is it quite fair then to keep your
face so steadily on my most light-hearted
works, and then say I recognise no evil?
Yet in the paper on Burns, for instance,
I show myself alive to some sorts of evil.
But then, perhaps, they are not your sorts.
</p>

<p>
And again: 'to say all'? All: yes.
Everything: no. The task were endless,
the effect nil. But my all, in such a vast
field as this of life, is what interests me,
what stands out, what takes on itself a
presence for my imagination or makes a
figure in that little tricky abbreviation
which is the best that my reason can conceive.
That I must treat, or I shall be
fooling with my readers. That, and not
the all of some one else.
</p>

<p>
And here we come to the division: not
only do I believe that literature should
give joy, but I see a universe, I suppose,
eternally different from yours: a solemn,
a terrible, but a very joyous and noble universe;
where suffering is not at least
wantonly inflicted, though it falls with dispassionate
partiality, but where it may be
and generally is nobly borne; where
above all (this I believe: probably you
don't: I think he may, with cancer) <i>any
brave man may make</i> out a life which shall
be happy for himself, and, by so being,
beneficent to those about him. And if
he fails, why should I hear him weeping?
I mean if I fail, why should I weep? why
should <i>you</i> hear <i>me</i>? Then to me morals,
the conscience, the affections, and the
passions are, I will own frankly and
sweepingly, so infinitely more important
than the other parts of life, that I conceive
men rather triflers who become immersed
in the latter; and I will always
think the man who keeps his lip stiff, and
makes 'a happy fireside clime,' and carries
a pleasant face about to friends and
neighbours, infinitely greater in the abstract
than an atrabilious Shakespeare or
a backbiting Kant or Darwin. No offence
to any of these gentlemen: two of whom
probably (one for certain) came up to my
standard.
</p>

<p>
And now enough said: it were hard if
a poor man could not criticise another
without having so much ink shed against
him. But I shall still regret you should
have written on an hypothesis you knew
to be untenable, and that you should thus
have made your paper, for those who do
not know me, essentially unfair. The rich,
foxhunting squire speaks with one voice;
the sick man of letters with another.&mdash;Yours
very truly,

(<i>Prometheus-Heine in minimis.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Here I go again. To me, the
medicine bottles on my chimney and the
blood on my handkerchief are accidents;
they do not colour my view of life, as you
would know, I think, if you had experience
of sickness; they do not exist in my
prospect; I would as soon drag them
under the eyes of my readers as I would
mention a pimple I might chance to have
(saving your presence) on my &mdash;&mdash;. What
does it prove? what does it change? it
has not hurt, it has not changed me in any
essential part; and I should think myself
a trifler and in bad taste if I introduced
the world to these unimportant privacies.
</p>

<p>
But again there is this mountain-range
between us: <i>that you do not believe me</i>. It
is not flattering, but the fault is probably
in my literary art.

done, I am at some liberty to write and
give you of my views. And first, many
thanks for the works that came to my
sickbed. And second, and more important,
as to the <i>Princess</i> [Cazamassima].
Well, I think you are going to do it this
time; I cannot, of course, foresee, but
these two first numbers seem to me picturesque
and sound and full of lineament,
and very much a new departure. As for
your young lady, she is all there; yes, sir,
you can do low life, I believe. The prison
was excellent; it was of that nature of
touch that I sometimes achingly miss
from your former work; with some of
the grime, that is, and some of the emphasis
of skeleton there is in nature. I
pray you to take grime in a good sense;
it need not be ignoble: dirt may have
dignity; in nature it usually has; and
your prison was imposing.
</p>

<p>
And now to the main point, why do we
not see you? Do not fail us. Make an
alarming sacrifice, and let us see "Henry
James's chair" properly occupied. I
never sit in it myself (though it was my
grandfather's); it has been consecrated
to guests by your approval, and now stands
at my elbow gaping. We have a new
room, too, to introduce to you: our last
baby, the drawing-room: it never cries,
and has cut its teeth. Likewise, there is
a cat now. It promises to be a monster
of laziness and self-sufficiency.
</p>

<p>
Pray see, in the November <i>Time</i> (a
dread name for a magazine of light reading),
a very clever fellow, W. Archer,
stating his views of me: the rosy-gilled
"athletico-æsthete": and warning me in
a fatherly manner that a rheumatic fever
would try my philosophy (as indeed it
would), and that my gospel would not do
for "those who are shut out from the exercise
of any manly virtue save renunciation."
To those who know that rickety
and cloistered spectre, the real R. L. S.,
the paper, besides being clever in itself,
presents rare elements of sport. The
critical parts are in particular very bright
and neat and often excellently true. Get
it by all manner of means.
</p>

<p>
I hear on all sides I am to be attacked
as an immoral writer; this is painful.
Have I at last got, like you, to the pitch
of being attacked? 'Tis the consecration
I lack&mdash;and could do without. Not that
Archer's paper is an attack, or what
either he or I, I believe, would call one;
'tis the attacks on my morality (which I
had thought a gem of the first water) I
referred to.&mdash;Yours affectionately,

["Prince Otto" had been published in

them by Mr. Henley, which to the writer's

displeasure had been pruned by the editor
before it was printed&mdash;the other by a
critic in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, who had
declared Otto to be "a fool and a wittol,"
and seen nothing but false style in
the flight of Seraphina through the forest.]
</p>

<p class="letter_head">
October 1885.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Lad</span>,&mdash;If there was any more
praise in what you wrote, I think [the
editor] has done us both a service; some
of it stops my throat. What, it would not
have been the same if Dumas or Musset
had done it, would it not? Well, no, I
do not think it would, do you know, now;
I am really of opinion it would not; and
a dam good job too. Why, think what
Musset would have made of Otto! Think
how gallantly Dumas would have carried
his crowd through! And whatever you
do, don't quarrel with &mdash;&mdash;. It gives me
much pleasure to see your work there; I
think you do yourself great justice in that
field; and I would let no annoyance,
petty or justifiable, debar me from such
a market. I think you do good there.
Whether (considering our intimate relations)
you would not do better to refrain
from reviewing me, I will leave to
yourself: were it all on my side, you
could foresee my answer; but there is
your side also, where you must be the
judge.
</p>

<p>
As for the <i>Saturday</i>. Otto is no 'fool,'
the reader is left in no doubt as to whether
or not Seraphina was a Messalina (though
much it would matter, if you come to
that); and therefore on both these points
the reviewer has been unjust. Secondly,
the romance lies precisely in the freeing
of two spirits from these court intrigues;
and here I think the reviewer showed himself
dull. Lastly, if Otto's speech is offensive
to him, he is one of the large class
of unmanly and ungenerous dogs who arrogate
and defile the name of manly. As
for the passages quoted, I do confess that
some of them reek Gorgonically; they are
excessive, but they are not inelegant after

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Low</span>,&mdash;<i>Lamia</i> has not yet
turned up, but your letter came to me this
evening with a scent of the Boulevard
Montparnasse that was irresistible. The
sand of Lavenue's crumbled under my
heel; and the bouquet of the old Fleury
came back to me; and I remembered the
day when I found a twenty franc piece
under my fetish. Have you that fetish
still? and has it brought you luck? I remembered,
too, my first sight of you in a
frock coat and a smoking-cap, when we
passed the evening at the Café de Medicis;
and my last when we sat and talked in the
Parc Monceau; and all these things made
me feel a little young again, which, to one
who has been mostly in bed for a month,
was a vivifying change.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you are lucky to have a bag that
holds you comfortably. Mine is a strange
contrivance; I don't die, damme, and I
can't get along on both feet to save my
soul; I am a chronic sickist; and my
work cripples along between bed and the
parlour, between the medicine bottle and
the cupping glass. Well, I like my life
all the same; and should like it none the
worse if I could have another talk with
you: though even my talks now are
measured out to me by the minute hand
like poisons in a minim glass.
</p>

<p>
A photograph will be taken of my ugly
mug and sent to you for ulterior purposes:
I have another thing coming out, which I
did not put in the way of the Scribners, I
can scarce tell how, but I was sick and
penniless and rather back on the world,
and mismanaged it. I trust they will forgive
me.
</p>

<p>
I am sorry to hear of Mrs. Low's illness,
and glad to hear of her recovery. I will
announce the coming <i>Lamia</i> to Bob; he
steams away at literature like smoke. I
have a beautiful Bob on my walls, and a
good Sargent, and a delightful Lemon;
and your etching now hangs framed in
the dining-room. So the arts surround
me,&mdash;Yours,

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Kinnicum</span>,&mdash;I am a very
bad dog, but not for the first time. Your
book, which is very interesting, came duly;
and I immediately got a very bad cold indeed,
and have been fit for nothing whatever.
I am a bit better now, and aye on
the mend: so I write to tell you, I thought
of you on New Year's Day; though, I
own, it would have been more decent if I
had thought in time for you to get my
letter then. Well, what can't be cured
must be endured, Mr. Lawrie; and you
must be content with what I give. If I
wrote all the letters I ought to write, and
at the proper time, I should be very good
and very happy; but I doubt if I should
do anything else.
</p>

<p>
I suppose you will be in town for the
New Year; and I hope your health is
pretty good. What you want is diet; but
it is as much use to tell you that as it is to
tell my father. And I quite admit a diet
is a beastly thing. I doubt, however, if it
be as bad as not being allowed to speak,
which I have tried fully, and do not like.
When, at the same time, I was not allowed
to read, it passed a joke. But these are
troubles of the past, and on this day, at
least, it is proper to suppose they won't
return. But we are not put here to enjoy
ourselves; it was not God's purpose; and
I am prepared to argue, it is not our sincere
wish. As for our deserts, the less said of
them the better, for some body might hear,
and nobody cares to be laughed at. A
good man is a very noble thing to see, but
not to himself; what he seems to God is,
fortunately, not our business; that is the
domain of faith; and whether on the first
of January or the thirty-first of December,
faith is a good word to end on.

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Gosse</span>,&mdash;Thank you for
your letter, so interesting to my vanity.
There is a review in the <i>St. James's</i>, which,
as it seems to hold somewhat of your opinions,
and is besides written with a pen
and not a poker, we think may possibly
be yours. The Prince has done fairly
well in spite of the reviews, which have
been bad; he was, as you doubtless saw,
well slated in the <i>Saturday</i>; one paper
received it as a child's story; another (picture
my agony) described it as a 'Gilbert
comedy.' It was amusing to see the race
between me and Justin M'Carthy; the
Milesian has won by a length.
</p>

<p>
That is the hard part of literature.
You aim high, and you take longer over
your work, and it will not be so successful
as if you had aimed low and
rushed it. What the public likes is work
(of any kind) a little loosely executed;
so long as it is a little wordy, a little
slack, a little dim and knotless, the dear
public likes it; it should (if possible) be
a little dull into the bargain. I know
that good work sometimes hits; but, with
my hand on my heart, I think it is by an
accident. And I know also that good
work must succeed at last; but that is not
the doing of the public; they are only
shamed into silence or affectation. I do
not write for the public; I do write for
money, a nobler deity; and most of all for
myself, not perhaps any more noble, but
both more intelligent and nearer home.
</p>

<p>
Let us tell each other sad stories of the
bestiality of the beast whom we feed.
What he likes is the newspaper; and to
me the press is the mouth of a sewer,
where lying is professed as from an university
chair, and everything prurient, and
ignoble, and essentially dull, finds its abode
and pulpit. I do not like mankind; but
men, and not all of these&mdash;and fewer
women. As for respecting the race, and,
above all, that fatuous rabble of burgesses
called 'the public,' God save me from such
irreligion,&mdash;that way lies disgrace and dishonour.
There must be something wrong
in me, or I would not be popular.
</p>

<p>
This is perhaps a trifle stronger than
my sedate and permanent opinion. Not
much, I think. As for the art that we
practice, I have never been able to see why
its professors should be respected. They
chose the primrose path; when they found
it was not all primroses, but some of it
brambly, and much of it uphill, they began
to think and to speak of themselves as holy
martyrs. But a man is never martyred in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
any honest sense in the pursuit of his
pleasure; and <i>delirium tremens</i> has more
of the honour of the cross. We were full
of the pride of life, and chose, like prostitutes,
to live by a pleasure. We should
be paid if we give the pleasure we pretend
to give; but why should we be honoured?
</p>

<p>
I hope some day you and Mrs. Gosse
will come for a Sunday; but we must wait
till I am able to see people. I am very
full of Jenkin's life; it is painful, yet very
pleasant, to dig into the past of a dead
friend, and find him, at every spadeful,
shine brighter. I own, as I read, I wonder
more and more why he should have taken
me to be a friend. He had many and obvious
faults upon the face of him; the
heart was pure gold. I feel it little pain
to have lost him, for it is a loss in which
I cannot believe; I take it, against reason,
for an absence; if not to-day, then to-morrow,
I still fancy I shall see him in the
door; and then, now when I know him
better, how glad a meeting! Yes, if I
could believe in the immortality business,
the world would indeed be too good to be
true; but we were put here to do what
service we can, for honour and not for hire;
the sods cover us, and the worm that never
dies, the conscience, sleeps well at last;
these are the wages, besides what we receive
so lavishly day by day; and they
are enough for a man who knows his own
frailty and sees all things in the proportion
of reality. The soul of piety was killed
long ago by that idea of reward. Nor is
happiness, whether eternal or temporal,
the reward that mankind seeks. Happinesses
are but his wayside campings; his
soul is in the journey; he was born for the
struggle, and only tastes his life in effort
and on the condition that he is opposed.
How, then, is such a creature, so fiery, so
pugnacious, so made up of discontent and
aspiration, and such noble and uneasy passions,
how can he be rewarded but by rest?
I would not say it aloud; for man's
cherished belief is that he loves that happiness
which he continually spurns and passes
by; and this belief in some ulterior
happiness exactly fits him. He does not
require to stop and taste it; he can be
about the rugged and bitter business where
his heart lies; and yet he can tell himself
this fairy-tale of an eternal tea-party, and
enjoy the notion that he is both himself
and something else; and that his friends
will yet meet him, all ironed out and emasculate,
and still be lovable; as if love did
not live in the faults of the beloved only,
and draw its breath in an unbroken round
of forgiveness? But the truth is, we must
fight until we die; and when we die there
can be no quiet for mankind but complete
resumption into&mdash;what?&mdash;God, let us
say&mdash;when all these desperate tricks will
lie spellbound at last.

[The next letter was written on receiving
from the United States a copy
of Messrs. Lippincotts's fine edition of
Keats's <i>Lamia</i>, illustrated by Mr. W. H.
Low, and bearing on the frontispiece
the dedication: "In testimony of loyal
friendship and of a common faith in
doubtful tales from faery land, I dedicate
to Robert Louis Stevenson my work
in this book"; together with the Latin
legend "<i>neque est ullum certius amicitiæ
vinculum quam consensus et societas consiliorum
et voluntatum</i>".]

<p class="letter_head">
Jan. 2nd, 1886.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Low</span>,&mdash;<i>Lamia</i> has come, and
I do not know how to thank you, not
only for the beautiful art of the designs,
but for the handsome and apt words of
the dedication. My favourite is "Bathes
unseen," which is a masterpiece; and the
next, "Into the green recessed woods,"
is perhaps more remarkable, though it
does not take my fancy so imperiously.
The night scene at Corinth pleases me
also. The second part offers fewer opportunities.
I own I should like to see
both <i>Isabella</i> and the <i>Eve</i> thus illustrated;
and then there's <i>Hyperion</i>&mdash;O,
yes, and <i>Endymion</i>! I should like to see
the lot: beautiful pictures dance before me
by hundreds: I believe <i>Endymion</i> would
suit you best. It, also, is in faery land;
and I see a hundred opportunities, cloudy
and flowery glories, things as delicate as
the cobweb in the bush; actions, not in
themselves of any mighty purport, but
made for the pencil: the feast of Pan,
Peona's isle, the "slabbèd margin of a
well," the chase of the butterfly, the
nymph, Glaucus, Cybele, Sleep on his
couch, a farrago of unconnected beauties.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
But I divagate; and all this sits in the
bosom of the publisher.
</p>

<p>
What is more important, I accept the
terms of the dedication with a frank heart,
and the terms of your Latin legend fairly.
The sight of your pictures has once more
awakened me to my right mind; something
may come of it; yet one more bold
push to get free of this prison-yard of the
abominably ugly, where I take my daily
exercise with my contemporaries. I do
not know, I have a feeling in my bones,
a sentiment which may take on the forms
of imagination, or may not. If it does, I
shall owe it to you; and the thing will
thus descend from Keats even if on the
wrong side of the blanket. If it can be
done in prose&mdash;that is the puzzle&mdash;I divagate
again. Thank you again; you
can draw and yet you do not love the
ugly: what are you doing in this age?
Flee, while it is yet time; they will have
your four limbs pinned upon a stable door
to scare witches. The ugly, my unhappy
friend, is <i>de rigueur</i>: it is the only wear!
What a chance you threw away with the
serpent! Why had Apollonius no pimples?
Heavens, my dear Low, you do
not know your business....

your picture suggested; as a kind of

nearer to than I. This is the life we have
chosen; well, the choice was mad, but I
should make it again.

What occurs to me is this: perhaps
they might be printed in (say) the <i>Century</i>
for the sake of my name; and if that
were possible, they might advertise your
book. It might be headed as sent in acknowledgment
of your <i>Lamia</i>. Or perhaps
it might be introduced by the phrases
I have marked above. I daresay they
would stick it in: I want no payment,
being well paid by <i>Lamia</i>. If they are
not, keep them to yourself.

Raskolnikoff is the greatest book I have
read easily in ten years; I am glad you
took to it. Many find it dull: Henry
James could not finish it: all I can say is,
it nearly finished me. It was like having
an illness. James did not care for it because
the character of Raskolnikoff was
not objective; and at that I divined a great
gulf between us, and, on further reflection,
the existence of a certain impotence in
many minds of to-day, which prevents
them from living <i>in</i> a book or a character,
and keeps them standing afar off, spectators
of a puppet show. To such I suppose
the book may seem empty in the centre;
to the others it is a room, a house of life,
into which they themselves enter, and are
tortured and purified. The Juge d'Instruction
I thought a wonderful, weird,
touching, ingenious creation: the drunken
father, and Sonia, and the student friend,
and the uncircumscribed, protoplasmic
humanity of Raskolnikoff, all upon a level
that filled me with wonder: the execution
also, superb in places. Another has been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
translated: <i>Humiliés et Offensés</i>. It is
even more incoherent than <i>Le Crime et le
Châtiment</i>; but breathes much of the
same lovely goodness, and has passages of
power. Dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell,
to be sure. Have you heard that he became
a stout imperialist conservative? It
is interesting to know. To something of
that side, the balance leans with me also, in
view of the incoherency and incapacity of
all. The old boyish idea of the march on
Paradise being now out of season, and all
plans and ideas that I hear debated being
built on a superb indifference to the first
principles of human character, a helpless
desire to acquiesce in anything of which I
know the worst assails me. Fundamental
errors in human nature of two sorts stand
on the skyline of all this modern world of
aspirations. First, that it is happiness that
men want; and second, that happiness
consists of anything but an internal harmony.
Men do not want, and I do not
think they would accept, happiness; what
they live for is rivalry, effort, success&mdash;the
elements our friends wish to eliminate.
And on the other hand, happiness is a
question of morality&mdash;or of immorality,
there is no difference&mdash;and conviction.
Gordon was happy in Khartoum, in his
worst hours of anger and fatigue; Marat
was happy, I suppose, in his ugliest frenzy;
Marcus Aurelius was happy in the detested
camp; Pepys was pretty happy, and I am
pretty happy on the whole, because we
both somewhat crowingly accepted a <i>via
media</i>, both liked to attend to our affairs,
and both had some success in managing
the same. It is quite an open question
whether Pepys and I ought to be happy,
on the other hand there is no doubt that
Marat had better be unhappy. He was
right (if he said it) that he was <i>la misère
humaine</i>, cureless misery&mdash;unless perhaps
by the gallows. Death is a great and
gentle solvent; it has never had justice
done it, no, not by Whitman. As for those
crockery chimney-piece ornaments, the
bourgeois (<i>quorum pars</i>), and their cowardly
dislike of dying and killing, it is merely
one symptom of a thousand how utterly
they have got out of touch of life. Their
dislike of capital punishment and their
treatment of their domestic servants are
for me the two flaunting emblems of their
hollowness.

<span class="smcap">Dear Locker</span>,&mdash;You take my verses
too kindly, but you will admit, for such a
bluebottle of a versifier to enter the house
of Gertrude, where her necklace hangs,
was not a little brave. Your kind invitation,
I fear, must remain unaccepted; and
yet&mdash;if I am very well&mdash;perhaps next
Spring&mdash;(for I mean to be very well)&mdash;my
wife might.... But all that is
in the clouds with my better health. And
now look here: you are a rich man and
know many people, therefore perhaps
some of the Governors of Christ's Hospital.
If you do, I know a most deserving
case, in which I would (if I could) do
anything. To approach you in this way,
is not decent; and you may therefore
judge by my doing it, how near this matter
lies to my heart. I enclose you a list
of the Governors, which I beg you to return,
whether or not you shall be able to
do anything to help me.

I was dangerously ill at Hyères, this brave
lady, who had then a sick husband of her
own (since dead) and a house to keep and
a family of four to cook for, all with her
own hands, for they could not afford a
servant, yet took watch-about with my
wife, and contributed not only to my comfort,
but to my recovery, in a degree that
I am not able to limit. You can conceive
how much I suffer from my impotence to
help her, and indeed I have already shown
myself a thankless friend. Let not my cry

That I should call myself a man of letters
and land myself in such unfathomable
ambiguities! No, my dear Locker, I did
not want a cheque; and in my ignorance
of business, which is greater even than my
ignorance of literature, I have taken the
liberty of drawing a pen through the document
and returning it; should this be
against the laws of God or man, forgive
me. All that I meant by my excessively
disgusting reference to your material well-being
was the vague notion that a man
who is well off was sure to know a Governor
of Christ's Hospital; though how I
quite arrived at this conclusion I do not
see. A man with a cold in the head does
not necessarily know a ratcatcher; and
the connection is equally close&mdash;as it now
appears to my awakened and somewhat
humbled spirit. For all that, let me thank
you in the warmest manner for your
friendly readiness to contribute. You say
you have hopes of becoming a miser; I
wish I had; but indeed I believe you deceive
yourself, and are as far from it as
ever. I wish I had any excuse to keep
your cheque, for it is much more elegant
to receive than to return; but I have my
way of making it up to you, and I do sincerely
beg you to write to the two Governors.
This extraordinary outpouring of
correspondence would (if you knew my
habits) convince you of my great eagerness
in this matter. I would promise gratitude;
but I have made a promise to myself
to make no more promises to anybody
else, having broken such a host already,
and come near breaking my heart in consequence;
and as for gratitude, I am by
nature a thankless dog, and was spoiled
from a child up. But if you can help this
lady in the matter of the hospital, you will
have helped the worthy. Let me continue
to hope that I shall make out my
visit in the Spring, and believe me, yours

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Locker</span>,&mdash;You are simply
an angel of light, and your two letters
have gone to the post; I trust they will
reach the hearts of the recipients; at least,
that could not be more handsomely expressed.
About the cheque, well now I
am going to keep it; but I assure you
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; has never asked me for
money, and I would not dare to offer any
till she did. For all that I shall stick to
the cheque now, and act to that amount
as your almoner. In this way I reward
myself for the ambiguity of my epistolary
style. I suppose, if you please, you may
say your verses are thin (would you so describe
an arrow, by the way? and one
that struck the gold? It scarce strikes me
as exhaustively descriptive), and, thin or
not, they are (and I have found them) inimitably
elegant. I thank you again very
sincerely for the generous trouble you
have taken in this matter which was so
near my heart, and you may be very certain
it will be the fault of my health and
not my inclination, if I do not see you before
very long; for all that has passed has
made me in more than the official sense
sincerely yours,

THE POINT OF VIEW
</h2>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">"A Hundred<br />
Thousand
Copies."</p>

<p>
What is the formula for writing a
book which will sell a hundred
thousand copies? Authors consider
the question with more or less interest,
publishers meditate upon it more closely still.
What sort of works is it that this interesting
experience befalls? Are they literary masterpieces?
Let us see. There was "David Harum;" so much of that
as is literature is chiefly horse stories&mdash;excellent
horse stories, without
"tendency" or moral purpose. The rest of it
that is good is made up of character sketches
in which David Harum is the character. It
is the kind of book of which you say, after
it has entertained you and kept you cheerful
for two or three evenings, that it is not much
of a book, but has mighty good things in it,
and the following morning you find it necessary
to buy two more copies to send away.
</p>

<p>
Then there is the "Dooley" book, which
has been doing its tens of thousands; that,
too, is a book which has good things in it
rather than a literary masterpiece; and though
the good things were better when served hot
in the newspapers, they do not lose all their
flavor when dished up on a cold plate.
</p>

<p>
There is a book from Kansas called "In
His Steps," which is reported to have sold by
the million, both in this country and in Great
Britain, which appeals to readers who are interested
in putting the precepts of the Gospels
into practical effect. There is not much
literature in that book either, and in reckoning
its readers it is proper to consider that
it has been issued in very cheap form.
</p>

<p>
That takes us nearly back to "Trilby,"
which had some literature in it, some theology,
much entertainment, and some structure;
and yet as a book it was rather a happy-go-lucky
work than a great novel. But it
sold far more than a hundred thousand.
Verily, with these examples in mind we must
feel that the literary race is not to the professionally
swift nor to the professionally literary.
For a living example of what we
should consider a legitimate success we have
to fall on Mr. Kipling, who has built up a
reputation in prose by good writing, and is
able to gather the fruits of it whenever he
puts forth his hand. It may be that in the
matter of poetry he has gathered a fig reputation
from a sowing rich in thistles, but that
has been because he has been progressive,
and finding his thistles so readily marketable
has been stirred to cause figs to follow them.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is our popular book going to
be? Shall it be a compilation of horse stories
like "David Harum," a religious story
like "In His Steps," a book like "Dooley," of
lively discourse on current events, or a
"Trilby," compounded of charm, mystery,
Bohemianism, love, theology, and music?
Alas, there is no formula. One may not
choose what he will write, nor plan before-hand
with any certainty to catch his myriad
of readers. The only shafts the author can
let fly are those that he finds in his quiver.
He may grow expert in shooting them; he
may bring down more readers with each successive
missile, but the arrows themselves
will always be those that he happens to have
in stock. All he can do is to select each one
in turn and look to its feathers and its point
and let it drive.
</p>

<p>
But while there is no sure method of writing
a book that will find a hundred thousand
buyers, the fact that nowadays the successful
book may succeed enormously, brings pleasant
thrills to the practitioner of letters. The
finding of a big nugget sets the hearts of all
the prospectors a-thump. The miraculous
draught agitates all the fishermen and makes
them experience, without sin, the delights
of holding a ticket in a lottery. Let us be
thankful, without envy, to the Fortunatuses
of letters. We&mdash;most of us&mdash;would be glad if
we too had the golden touch, and yet we need
not sorrow if we haven't it, for it has its
drawbacks, and once the possession of it is
demonstrated, it tends to make its owner
merchant first and writer afterward. His
wares are so precious that he is bound to
turn trader; his success is so notorious that
he is constrained to be a public character,
and he pays in part for phenomenal good
luck by the loss of a valuable obscurity. Let
us be sympathetic with literary popularity
rather than unduly stirred by it. Let us say,
"Poor Jones, his book has sold a hundred
thousand and he has gone to Europe. What
a desperate chore it will be to keep that up&mdash;if
he can keep it up&mdash;and what a bump he
will get if he finds that he can't."

<h2 class="boxed_header">
THE FIELD OF ART
</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="s08">
<i>CONCERNING PAINTERS WHO WOULD
EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN WORDS</i>
</h3>

<p>
Let us consider some of the difficulties
of the artist in dealing with subjects
that are to be considered in other
modes than his own.
</p>

<p>
The artist is of necessity extremely stubborn,
like men who have to do things; impressionable
as a man who must push the
tiller at the slightest warning, for he must be
both rudder and helmsman. He is unjust
very often, for he sees men before principles&mdash;often,
alas, the man whom he sees being
himself. He is unaffected to a surprising
degree by criticism or advice from outside,
and extremely careful of it from within the
circle. He is doubtful and irresponsive in
answer to reasoning not clearly put into his
own terms of thinking. Like the Chinese
philosopher, the artist is apt to say, or to
think without saying, "What is proven by
the fact that your dialectics are better than
mine, and that your mind has a better use
and handling of logic? Nothing more than
these very facts of your powers. Is, therefore,
what you say true because I cannot confute
it? All this, you say, may be right in
the terms of another way of looking at things,
but it does not seem to be so in any arrangement
that I can make of mine." "<i>E pur si
muove</i>," he would have answered, like Galileo,
to arguments in his own mode but based
upon theological and therefore extraneous
views.
</p>

<p>
Far down within him remains a dislike of
a closed and finished proposition. He is
Bagehot's Englishman. He does not wish
to commit himself to a statement that twice
two make five, but he is also extremely unwilling
to pin himself to the statement that twice
two make four. His mind lives in the practical,
in the joining of the ideal with the real,
which does not prevent his being a dreamer&mdash;in
fact, confirms him in that direction. All
these things he has in common with the man
of practical action who, himself, in these
things, recalls the attitude of mind said to be
feminine.
</p>

<p>
As he works for no result outside of his
work&mdash;that is to say that the emotions produced
by him upon himself and upon others
are not prolonged outside of the work itself&mdash;he
is kept more and more within a circle of
unprovable suppositions, within a method of
applying thought that seems satisfactory, as
it is complete in its circuit. For, as you
know, he gives only a fictitious pain, a fictitious
sadness&mdash;and no real sorrow or hurt
comes from his most beautiful tragedy; indeed,
it produces an exaltation of the mind
not disconnected with joy. Confined within
his own circle he generally loses the use of
the methods of words; and he is often, and
most wisely and rightly, unwilling to handle
them; for he has the most complete and
almost superstitious respect for the mastery
of tools in methods of appreciation. When
he uses words he finds that they are tools
whose use he does not know&mdash;living tools
that refuse to work, that stumble over each
other, that lead him astray, that turn on him
sometimes, or actually direct his path, instead
of being led by him; until at length he recognizes
that they are old acquaintances in new
forms. They are the signs of thought, of
ideas, and perceptions. <i>They are not these
last themselves.</i> And he becomes both delighted
and timid; pleased, because words
express differently and yet like his tools;
timid, because how long and difficult and endless
perhaps are their full use and mastery.
He sees also that each one is an abstraction;
that each phrase, and often each word, has
involved the consumption, the absorption,
the waste of hundreds of sensations concerning
still more objects. To put into record
merely the impressions of nature, he has only
a few notes, and he knows that these external
appearances that delight him are written
in an infinite gamut. Before the accurate and
full description of anything that he sees could
be worked out in words, it would have decayed
and been born again many times. He
sees that the essence of these tools is to generalize,
and thereby to leave over in each
thing something that is inexpressible. All
this reminds him of the failures and inadequacies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
of his own art, wherein (in those moments
of despair which are the consequence
of passionate attachment) he feels that he has
felt all, and that his miserable means only allow
him to express a part. This eternal enemy&mdash;so
much loved&mdash;nature, never meets him
half-way for more than a moment. Just as
he closes the circle of the little world he has
made, in which he thinks, for a moment, that
she is imprisoned, and says to himself and
to us&mdash;There! she passes on making other
worlds and creating continual appearances.
</p>

<p>
How is he in days like this, when the life
of the seasons is beginning again, to paint
the spring that delights him? He can paint
some trees and a little sky, and the reflections
of water. How can he paint its murmur?
How can he paint the settling restlessness of
the air above him? How can he paint the
forgotten odors of new growth? How can
he paint that "becoming" of the season, in
which is also expressed the faint sadness of a
past long put aside?
</p>

<p>
Surely he feels that all is inadequate, and
that the only happy one is he who forgets to
paint, and only looks without seeing.
</p>

<p>
He may turn to those who work in other
ways, but who also&mdash;he becomes more and
more sure of it&mdash;have limitations not unlike
his. But those limitations are not his, and
they are not responsible to him, and so far he
can be happy with them. With them he can
continue the dreams of a complete recall and
perception. And when they fail he does not
suffer; he is more willing to see that they
could not look at everything from every point
of view at once.
</p>

<p>
He recognizes with some amusement how
words, and consequently ideas, are placed in
masses, as he places forms and colors; and
is occasionally even a little worried when
what he considers styles are confused, and
thought which he respects is brushed about
for effect or for purpose, like so much paint.
</p>

<p>
And he recognizes that just as with him in
the modes he knows, minds are caught in the
net of imitation, and fly around and about it
without escaping, so that they are even affected
in their deepest soul&mdash;that this often
comes from using certain manners and certain
styles, "for that the matter of style very
much comes out of the manner," and the outside
reacts upon the inner.
</p>

<p>
He gives up asking for all sorts of truth in
any one form of language, and does not lose
the interest, the exhilaration that Shakespeare
gives because his Marc Antony does not include
all, besides, that history has told.
Science cannot wither the charm of Cleopatra.
</p>

<p>
At some such moment, when he sees
thought more clearly, and is reverential toward
the minds that live in ideas, he may be
asked, as I have been, to express in words his
beliefs and perceptions. At such a moment,
forgetful of early experiences, that were both
confusing and disenchanting, but are long
past and faded, he may do as I have done&mdash;open
some page of a writer&mdash;some person
who thinks in words and who thinks about
art.
</p>

<p>
He finds that that writer has asked art to
tell "the truth," but has forgotten to ask of
it sincerity. In reality he has forbidden the
artist to express himself while expressing
things. He has asked him to go out of his
own humanity, out of his own thought, his
own emotion, his own proper affection, and
try to execute what he thinks proper to cause
on others such and such an impression.
Nothing can relieve this tendency from the
duplicity which looks toward the public, and
only lives to act upon the spectators.
</p>

<p>
This is not the painter's art of painting. In
minds like that of Mr. Ruskin, the destiny
thus given to painting would be certainly one
of the noblest and most useful of functions,
but it has the fault of being impossible. No
more could music, while agitating my nerves
according to the laws of harmony, teach me
at the same time as from the chair of a professor.
</p>

<p>
No, never, however shocking it may sound
in or out of studios, never has truth in the ordinary
sense of the word been the end of art.
The value of a painting as a means of making
us know the nature of realities shall have
nothing in common with its value as a work
of art.
</p>

<p>
Truth is not the pictorial essence of a painting;
it is, on the contrary, the manner or
means of the painting's addressing ordinary
intelligence; all the general powers that the
artist has in common with other men, but
which faculties and powers do not constitute
his artistic side, that part of himself which he
tries to please, to represent, to disengage, to
assert in his painting.
</p>

<p>
He may, of course, because his profession
is partly a profession or art of sight, teach
how to see&mdash;how to see better and farther
and more delicately; but this is only incidental,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
and is good so far as it does not injure or
detract from his own special duty. Of course
he should not shock or annoy the most intelligent
part of our intelligence, so that our
other instincts that meet his may not be troubled
in their peaceful enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, according to time and place, in
one way for the mediæval mind, in another
for the Oriental, in another for us of to-day,
it is advisable that he conform somewhat to
the general knowledge that composes the
vague ideas of a public; that he do not contradict
too squarely scientific exactness that
is fairly familiar.
</p>

<p>
But nothing can be falser than to measure
his merit by the instruction he gives us. In
the first place, if what he does is a lesson of
observation, the effort to understand it is so
much to detract from the spectator's emotion.
Secondly, if a painter wishes to teach he will
no longer be carried away by his special emotions,
the one thing in which he is stronger
than we. He cannot, even if he wishes&mdash;and
this will explain the cause of certain
blunders that have astonished us. It is for
the scientific, the religious mind to remove
our ignorances and correct our moral defects;
it is not the duty of the artistic mind.
</p>

<p>
No more than when I am dead and have
found the Reality, now vaguely seen in this
world of appearances, should I expect of the
divine who may preach my funeral sermon to
try to decide what may have been my errors
in the technique of the art of painting.
</p>

<p>
Nor, of course, can the end of art be untruth.
Teachings like those of Mr. Ruskin,
far more common than they should be (because
of our natural want of humility and
charity, and the narrowness of the fields into
which accident forces us), divide absolutely
our art into two kinds&mdash;those that give images
of things just as they are, and those
that give images of things just as they are
not; such a dilemma as worries the child's
mind.
</p>

<p>
"Things as they are" may mean so much
as to be meaningless. If we mean things as
they are in themselves, only God can so see
them as to enclose them and leave nothing
outside but falsehood. For us, we see but as
in a mirror darkly. We have a few imperfect
senses, and such moral faculties as we
manage to distinguish the one from the other,
and which we have to complete by making
one act upon the others.
</p>

<p>
So that for us there exist many truths. We
have truths of smell, before which all things
are absorbed in one or more impressions of
odor. We have the truths of the eyes, for
which all is appearance. We have the truths
of intelligence, for which there are ideas;
truths of feeling for which there are impressions;
and many others in a long list perhaps
exhaustless; and I only use these definitions
for our momentary convenience.
</p>

<p>
Now, in connection with which of these
truths must the painter represent the manner
of existence of objects?
</p>

<p>
That is the question the painter must ask
himself&mdash;that must be his canon of æsthetics.
He cannot exile the truths that affect his
specialty, however much he may care for the
others. It is possible for him to let the truths
of one kind affect his own, but his own must
predominate, or the work of art will not exist.
</p>

<p>
Persons like Mr. Ruskin think that they
are fighting the cause of truth against falsehood.
In fact, they are making one truth
fight another, with injury to both.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible that a work of art should
define like science and still move like poetry.
</p>

<p>
It is precisely that point of which I spoke
first, that tendency of the artist which makes
him not a reasoner but a seer, which gives
him the unexplainable power of impressing us
in a way that we can only analyze afterward.
It is because he can escape from the rule of
his intelligence, can become a being that does
not judge, can become as a little child, no
longer see things through ideas, but merely
feel the agitation of a love, an unexplainable
passion. As if he felt the breath that animates
the world behind a covering of what
we call realities.
</p>

<p>
It is in this way that he is an awkward man
when he tries to handle the tools which we
generally call <i>language</i>&mdash;that is to say, words
and phrases; in so far, at least, as he has to
use them, to explain the ideas and sentiments
involved in his own language. This is all the
more difficult in that literature, the language
of words, has not become acquainted as yet
with this mind of the artist, and has not furnished
to the artist special tools to define his
intentions and position. It is because of the
peculiarities of his work, which we have just
considered, that no person can explain that
work perfectly in terms of words; while he,
the artist himself, grows continually more
averse to handle words which seem unsatisfactory,
and, naturally, becomes more and
more unfit to use them.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
